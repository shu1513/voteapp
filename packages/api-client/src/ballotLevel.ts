// The government level a race belongs to, for the district-size sorts'
// collapsible level sections on the elections list. Mirrors ballotLevelRank
// in the backend's ballotElectionOrdering.ts, which orders the payload by
// this rank (biggest: presidential → city; smallest: the reverse) before
// population, so the list's level grouping stays purely presentational —
// consecutive runs, never a reorder.
//
// Keyed on office.scope with district_type as the fallback (ballot measures
// have no office): the two vocabularies share their words. School boards
// fold into "City" — "school district" is a level no voter thinks in, and
// the section label says "City" rather than "place" for the same reason.

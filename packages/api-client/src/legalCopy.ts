// The pre-search clickwrap is split in two: a one-sentence label naming every
// document, plus a dialog holding the two sentences a first-time visitor has
// to read before results mean anything. Three paragraphs of small print above
// the Search button was skimmed past, which is the failure mode a clickwrap
// cannot afford; a summary the visitor actually reads, with the full text one
// click away and re-shown at the moment of agreement, is the pattern the
// clickwrap cases reward (Meyer v. Uber; Berman v. Freedom Financial; Sellers
// v. JustAnswer).
//
// This label deliberately does NOT name arbitration; SIGNUP_CHECKBOX_LABEL and
// RENEWAL_CHECKBOX_LABEL still do, and that asymmetry is the point:
//
// - What the clickwrap cases require is conspicuous notice of the TERMS plus
//   an unambiguous act of assent, not a callout of any particular clause. The
//   registration screen enforced in Meyer v. Uber, 868 F.3d 66 (2d Cir. 2017)
//   said only "By creating an Uber account, you agree to the TERMS OF SERVICE
//   & PRIVACY POLICY"; the word "arbitration" was nowhere on it. An empty
//   checkbox that gates the action clears that bar by a wider margin than
//   Uber's click-to-continue did.
// - Anonymous acceptance is never recorded server-side (see
//   docs/legal/checkbox-copy.md), so this gate was never the evidence a
//   Section 12 motion would rest on. The account acceptance ledger is, and the
//   signup label spells arbitration out in full before a row is written.
// - The cost was real and one-sided: it is the first screen a stranger sees
//   after typing their address to look up a ballot.
//
// What must NOT be dropped is the Terms of Use link beside this label. The
// notice is the named, linked document at the moment of assent; that link is
// the whole basis on which Section 12 binds an anonymous searcher.

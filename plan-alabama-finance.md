# Alabama Campaign Finance Plan

Written 2026-08-26 after two probe passes of the Alabama FCPA system (findings + verification detail in `backend/docs/alabama-campaign-finance.md`, including two addenda that cross-checked an external feasibility report and a terse implementation spec point-by-point). Totals-only module: Alabama does not collect donor occupation/employer, and its disclosure schema has no independent-expenditure target or support/oppose direction, so both are structurally unavailable — not sparse.

## Goal and v1 scope

State-level candidates on the November 2026 ballot (statewide, legislature, judicial; county deferred, municipal excluded):

- Total raised, total spent, cash on hand — from the state's own race-level summary API, verified against bulk extracts.
- Direct-contribution size buckets from itemized cash rows.
- `outsideSupportTotal` / `outsideOpposeTotal` stored as **null, never zero**. No outside-group rows. No occupation rows. No new frontend work: nulls render through the existing UI (sections absent, never $0); coverage detail lives in sync diagnostics.

Out of scope permanently (source limitation, do not revisit without a statute change): occupation/employer breakdowns; candidate-directed outside spending. Rejected inference routes (FEC name-matching, people-data services, expenditure free-text, PAC-name heuristics) are documented in the findings doc and stay rejected.

Out of scope for v1 (revisit later): county candidates (enable after exact-identity link audit), municipal candidates (HB 156: no filing legitimately means ≤$1,000 activity — needs UI that distinguishes `not required to file` from `filed zero` before enabling), PAC funder/industry views.

## Source model (all verified live 2026-08-26)

System: Tyler entellitrak app at `https://fcpa.alabamavotes.gov/` ("AL Campaign Finance System"). No auth, no CAPTCHA, JSON responses. The pre-2025 `PublicSite` system is dead — any old URLs redirect to a login page.

**TLS:** the server sends an incomplete certificate chain. The client must supply the missing intermediate CA (custom `connect.ca` on an Undici `Agent` passed as `fetch(..., { dispatcher })` — a Node `https.Agent` would not affect Undici/global fetch; intermediate fetched once and committed as a PEM fixture, see `alabamaFcpaTls.ts`). Never disable verification.

### Primary: political race search (roster + totals)

`GET /page.request.do?page=com.acf.common.page.politicalracesearchresults&pageNumber=1&pageSize=100&sortDirection=ASC&sortBy=candidate&election=160&office=<id>[&jurisdiction=<id>&district=<id>&party=<id>]`

- `election=160` = "2026 ELECTION CYCLE". Election/office/jurisdiction dropdown id maps are embedded in the search page HTML (`page=page.acfPublicPoliticalRaceSearch`); scrape them per sync, do not hard-code beyond 160 + verified office ids (23 = Governor).
- **Omit the `year` param for cycle totals.** It works but takes an internal option id from the page's `financialYear` dropdown (1 = 2026, 12 = 2025 — NOT the literal year, which returns 0 rows). Year-scoped rows attribute money differently from the extracts' contribution-date years (Jones 2025: race-year row $105,546.38 vs extract $588,344.73) — never mix them; the no-year response is the authoritative cycle aggregate.
- Row fields: `COMMITTEEID` (internal id), `CANDIDATE`, `CANDIDATESTATUS`, `BEGINNINGFUNDS`, `MONETARYCONTRIB`, `MONETARYEXP`, `NONMONETARYCONTRIB`, `OTHERSOURCES`, `ENDINGFUNDS`, `YEAR`. **No district/jurisdiction column** — a legislative office query returns every district's candidates in one flat list (State Rep: 193 rows). District comes from joining `COMMITTEEID` → committee-search `id`, whose `jurisdiction` field carries it ("HOUSE DISTRICT 68"); verified live 2026-08-28: 193/193 State Rep race rows join; 192/193 have jurisdiction populated (the gap is a 06/2026 registration with no jurisdiction or place — the resolver fails closed to manual review on missing district).
- Verified accounting identity: `ENDINGFUNDS = BEGINNINGFUNDS + MONETARYCONTRIB + OTHERSOURCES − MONETARYEXP` (in-kind and line-of-credit excluded, matching the portal's own warning). Tuberville exact to the cent. Jones shows a $500.00 residual in the aggregate contribution/expenditure columns, but `ENDINGFUNDS` itself is filing-chain-validated: July monthly cover ending balance $1,659,100.23 + the $20,000.00 Major Contribution Report filed 08/26 = $1,679,100.23 exactly. Trust `ENDINGFUNDS`; treat column residuals as a reconcile-tolerance item.
- Verified cross-year cent-exactness vs extracts: Jones `MONETARYEXP` 1,984,347.70 = 2026 extract 1,962,002.67 + 2025 report 22,345.03.
- **VoteApp ballot data is the roster.** The resolver iterates our Nov-2026 candidates; race rows are the FCPA-side match-and-totals source. Within FCPA, race rows beat the PCC committee search for that job (2026 Governor: 9 race rows incl. Tuberville and dissolved candidates vs 22 "Active" committees incl. 2022 leftovers) — committee search is metadata fallback only (internal id ↔ FCPA committeeId ↔ party/office).

### Secondary: bulk extracts (size buckets + verification)

Catalog: `GET /page.request.do?page=com.acf.common.page.transactiondatadownloadsresults&pageSize=100&pageNumber=1&sortDirection=ASC&sortBy=state` → `{DATATYPE, YEAR, LASTUPDATED, DOWNLOAD:<id>}` per file (2013–2026, 4 types, regenerated daily ~02:32 AM CT). Download: `page=getTransactionData&id=<DOWNLOAD>` → zip with one CSV. **Ids are catalog rows, not stable — re-read the catalog every sync.**

v1 needs only the Cash Contributions extract, pulled for every transaction-date year in scope — not just 2025 + 2026: Phase 0 found a 2025-registered committee with a 2024-dated contribution living in the 2024 file, so the extract-year window is the transaction-date years (2024–2026 observed), not the committee's registration life:

- Header: `CommitteeId,ContributionAmount,ContributionDate,LastName,FirstName,MI,Suffix,Address1,City,State,Zip,ContributionID,FiledDate,ContributionType,ContributorType,CommitteeType,CommitteeName,CandidateName,Amended`.
- `CommitteeId` here is the FCPA committee number (e.g. 32837), NOT the race row's internal `COMMITTEEID` (e.g. 7962). The committee search response carries both (`committeeId` + `id`); the resolver must store both.
- The cash file **embeds in-kind rows** (`ContributionType` = In-Kind …) with the same transaction ids the separate In-Kind extract uses; in-kind ids never collide with cash ids. v1 ignores the In-Kind file entirely and filters in-kind rows out of size buckets.
- Extracts are current-state snapshots: transaction ids are unique, `Amended=Y` marks the current post-amendment version — **keep those rows**, never drop or double-load.
- ~2.5% of expenditure-extract lines are malformed (unescaped quotes: wrong field counts plus lines swallowed into neighbors — 877/34,505 in the 2026 file); the cash file is nearly clean (4 mis-fielded rows in the 2026-08-26 snapshot; files regenerate daily, so counts drift — assert by method, not exact number). The parser must be tolerant: count and report skipped lines, never abort the file, never silently mis-assign columns (a row whose `ContributionAmount` fails numeric parse or whose `ContributionID` is non-numeric is quarantined, not guessed at).

### Tertiary: verification anchors

- Filing detail page (`page=page.acfPublicFilingDetail&filingId=<n>`): structured per-report cover — beginning/ending balance, itemized/non-itemized splits. Correct balance anchor. (The `acfPublicCommitteeFinancialSummary` page takes the internal id **plain, not base64**, and can anchor to a Major Contribution Report with no balance accounting — do not use it for balances.)
- Interactive searches export max 20,000 rows — human verification only, never ingestion.

## Summary mapping

| Writer field | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `totalReceipts` | race row | `MONETARYCONTRIB + NONMONETARYCONTRIB + OTHERSOURCES` |
| `directContributionTotal` | race row | `MONETARYCONTRIB + NONMONETARYCONTRIB` |
| `totalDisbursements` | race row | `MONETARYEXP` (state accounting excludes line-of-credit; statewide LOC ≈ 0.4% of well-formed 2026 spend — $312,710.75 vs $76.8M) |
| `cashOnHand` | race row | `ENDINGFUNDS` (filing-chain-validated; includes post-cover major-contribution reports) |
| `outsideSupportTotal` / `outsideOpposeTotal` | — | null |
| direct `contribution_size` rows | cash extract | itemized cash rows only — exclude in-kind rows, `Cash (Non-Itemized)`, and `ContributorType = Returned (Cash Only)` rows (Florida precedent: in-kind/refund/returned stay out of direct buckets); amounts are signed (negative rows exist — 1 in the 2026 file) and must be handled, never abs()'d |
| `occupation` rows / outside rows | — | none written |

Freshness/reconcile note: displayed totals carry **no dollar tolerance** — the Phase 0 authority contract validates race totals cent-exact against the committee's filed report covers (same source, no time window). Extracts are never an acceptance check on totals: they lag (~02:32 AM regeneration, one day's filings drift — observed exactly $20,000 on Jones) and can permanently omit filed rows, so extract-vs-race comparison is a **coverage ratio** for the size buckets (observed 0.989–1.0), reported in sync diagnostics under the rule in Phase 3.

## Phase 0: reconciliation probe (no schema, no flags)

**STATUS: DONE 2026-08-26 — PASSED; re-run 2026-08-28 — PASSED** (`npm run alabama-candidates:finance:phase-zero`, `ok: true`; the re-run added legislative + judicial enumeration — State Rep 193 rows, State Senator 68, Supreme Court Associate Justice 4 — and a district-join gate: 193/193 State Rep race rows join the committee search, jurisdiction populated on all but 1). Key outcome: the gate became the **authority contract** — race totals == Σ filed-report covers, cent-exact (verified 3 fixtures incl. 99-filing Tuberville and 10-amendment Boyd) — while extracts get a coverage ratio (observed 0.989–1.0; they can miss rows covers contain). Full findings in `backend/docs/alabama-campaign-finance.md` §Phase 0 results. Consequences for later phases: totals from race API, buckets from extracts with coverage reported; extract-year window = transaction-date years (2024 file needed); Major Contribution Report covers have a reduced layout; filing-detail fetches need retries.

The spec below is the original pre-run gate, kept for the record. Where it conflicts with the STATUS line above or the findings doc's §Phase 0 results (which replaced extract-sum reconciliation and the extracts-as-primary fallback with the covers authority contract), the findings doc wins.

Script `npm run alabama-candidates:finance:phase-zero` (pattern: `newHampshirePhaseZero.ts`). Must demonstrate, against live data:

1. Race rows for ≥3 offices (Governor + one legislative chamber + one judicial) enumerate correctly from scraped dropdown ids under election 160.
2. For ≥3 committees spanning large/small: race `MONETARYCONTRIB + NONMONETARYCONTRIB` reconciles to cash-extract sums (2025+2026) within the one-day freshness tolerance, and `MONETARYEXP` reconciles to expenditure-extract sums + prior-year covers cent-exact.
3. Aggregate-column residuals are characterized: confirm whether `MONETARYCONTRIB` counts `Returned (Cash Only)` rows positively (their extract amounts are positive), and bound the Jones-style $500 column residual. `ENDINGFUNDS` is already filing-chain-validated; the freshness rule (race API includes same-day filings the 02:32 AM extracts lack — observed $20,000 Major Contribution Report) sets the reconcile tolerance.
4. Amendment behavior: pick a committee with `Amended=Y` rows, confirm the extract row matches the current filing detail (not the superseded version).
5. TLS: client connects with the pinned intermediate, verification on.

Stop rule: if (2) fails outside tolerance on any committee, do not proceed — fall back to extracts-as-primary (the slower path the findings doc originally sketched) and re-plan.

## Phase 1: client, cache, parser

**STATUS: DONE 2026-08-28.** Client, CSV parser, and TLS shipped with the Phase 0 PR; this phase added `alabamaFcpaArtifactCache.ts` (raw-zip artifact cache with integrity metadata, unchanged-detection on CSV checksum since zips recompress daily, verified read-back that fails closed on corruption) plus tests, and split the client's download into raw-zip-bytes + unzip so the cache stores exactly what the portal served. No separate `alabamaFinanceTypes.ts` — types live in the client/csv modules where they are used. Live-verified: 2024 cash extract cached (57,908 rows, 2 quarantined), second refresh reported `unchanged`.

`backend/src/pipeline/alabamaFinance/`:

- `alabamaFcpaClient.ts` — race search, dropdown-id scrape, extract catalog + download, committee search (fallback), filing detail + filings-list fetch (`committeeelectronicfilingsresults&committeeId=<internal id>`). Every list endpoint paginates via `totalRecords` (never assume one page). Concurrency 1–2, bounded timeouts, pinned CA.
- `alabamaFcpaArtifactCache.ts` — raw zip bytes keyed by (dataType, year) with retrieval time, source URL, checksum; reject HTML bodies/empty archives/changed headers; keep last good artifact on failure (pattern: `newHampshireCfsArtifactCache.ts`).
- `alabamaFcpaCsv.ts` — tolerant cash-extract parser per the rules above, with skipped-line accounting surfaced in the sync report.

Tests: fixture zips (small hand-built CSVs incl. ragged lines, in-kind rows, Amended=Y, returned contributions); race/committee search JSON fixtures; no live calls.

## Phase 2: schema, flags, source label (launch checklist — see voteapp-new-state-finance-checklist)

- Migration `NNN_add_alabama_campaign_finance_tables.sql` — next free number at implementation time (≥257; check open finance PRs #885/#886/#887 for claimed numbers first; never renumber). All five standard tables so `standardStateFinanceSnapshotWriter` works unchanged: `al_candidate_finance_links`, `_summaries`, `_direct_breakdowns`, `_outside_groups`, `_outside_group_breakdowns` (outside tables stay empty by design). All identifiers ≤63 chars.
- `featureFlags.ts`: `ALABAMA_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_ENABLED`, `ALABAMA_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_SYNC_ENABLED`, plus `ALABAMA_FCPA_RAW_DATA_REFRESH_ENABLED` gating the artifact-refresh command (NH pattern) with its `npm run alabama:finance:refresh-artifacts` script; code defaults false; document in `backend/.env.example` (tracked, alphabetical — NH pattern), set in local `backend/.env`, and add the read flag to `render.yaml` (prod values live in Render's environment).
- Source enum `ALABAMA_FCPA` in `ballotLookupFinanceShared.ts`; `FINANCE_SOURCE_LABELS` entry "Alabama FCPA Reporting System" in `packages/api-client/src/format.ts` (alphabetical) + `format.test.ts` case; **`FINANCE_SOURCE_HOME_URLS` entry** (`https://fcpa.alabamavotes.gov/`) in `packages/api-client/src/finance.ts` + its test.
- Keep `backend/docs/alabama-campaign-finance.md` updated (committed with the Phase 0 PR).

**STATUS: DONE 2026-08-28.** Migration `263_add_alabama_campaign_finance_tables.sql` (Montana 261 twin; validated by a full from-scratch migration run on a throwaway local database). One deliberate addition beyond the spec above: the links table carries a nullable `fcpa_committee_number` column (extract `CommitteeId`, e.g. 32837) alongside `committee_id` (internal portal id, e.g. 7962), because Phase 3 requires storing both ids and the standard snapshot writer's fixed link upsert can only populate `committee_id` — the resolver backfills the extra column and the sync skips buckets (with a diagnostic) while it is NULL. `link_source` values are `('manual', 'fcpa_race_search')`. Flags + refresh script shipped as specced, except the npm script name follows the fleet convention instead of the bullet above: `npm run alabama-candidates:finance:raw:refresh` (NH twin; repeatable `--year` off one catalog read, `--artifact-kind`, `--cache-dir` / `ALABAMA_FCPA_RAW_DATA_CACHE_DIR`, `--timeout-ms`, `--force` bypassing only the refresh sub-gate, and a separate `--accept-empty` for the cache's zero-row guard — gate bypass is routine, discarding a populated artifact for an empty extract is not, so they never share a flag). `ALABAMA_FCPA` registered in the source union + `FINANCE_SUMMARY_SOURCES`, label + home-URL maps + tests. `render.yaml` read flag added as `"false"` until Alabama data reaches prod. Local `backend/.env` lives in the main checkout (worktree discipline) — add the three flags there by hand before the Phase 4 live run.

## Phase 3: resolver, sync, loader

- `alabamaFinanceEligibleOffices.ts` — explicit office allowlist (statewide + legislature + judicial), the only offices the resolver touches.
- `alabamaCandidateResolver.ts` — VoteApp Nov-2026 candidates in allowlisted offices → race rows. Link requires normalized candidate name match + compatible office/district (district via the committee-search `jurisdiction` join — race rows carry no district column) + election cycle; store internal `COMMITTEEID`, FCPA `committeeId`, and source URL. Ambiguity (two plausible rows, or race row absent for a ballot candidate) fails closed to manual review. Never link on name alone. Auto-link must never overwrite a `linkSource: manual` row.
- `alabamaCandidateFinanceSync.ts` — per linked candidate: summary from live race row; `contribution_size` buckets from cached cash extracts filtered to the FCPA committeeId and transaction-date-year window; cash coverage ratio = (itemized + non-itemized extract cash) ÷ race `MONETARYCONTRIB`, always reported. Coverage gates **buckets only, never the summary** — a lagging or permanently incomplete extract must not leave authoritative totals stale: outside [0.97, 1.01] (brackets the observed 0.989–1.0 with headroom for one day's filings drift; above 1.01, or race total 0 with nonzero extract cash, means a bad committee join), write the race-row summary with no size buckets plus a diagnostic. Full-replacement write via `createStandardStateFinanceSnapshotWriter`; keep the previous snapshot only when the race row or covers themselves fail to fetch/parse.
- Loader `directCoverageNote` (house pattern — GA/MO/RI/Denver/WA): tell voters the size buckets cover itemized cash contributions only, while the raised total also includes non-itemized cash, in-kind, and other receipts.
- `alabamaBallotLookupFinanceLoader.ts` via `standardStateFinanceBallotLookupLoader`, registered alongside the other states; due-list mechanics per the finance sync runbook (link-gated).
- Sync diagnostics per candidate: extract last-updated stamp, skipped-line counts, itemized vs non-itemized dollars, reconcile delta, explicit `occupation_unavailable` / `outside_unavailable` reasons.

**STATUS: DONE 2026-08-28.** Shipped as the SC file shape: `alabamaFinanceEligibleOffices.ts` (v1 allowlist = 9 statewide keys incl. `State Level Judge` + both chambers; FCPA office-label map pinned from the live dropdown — `Lt. Governor`, `Commissioner of Agriculture & Industries` needs the `&amp;` decode, judicial routed by ballot-title regex, no-rule titles fail closed), `alabamaCandidateRaceResolver.ts` (full-name match via the shared middle-evidence helper; trailing-suffix commas rewritten "Julius Walker, Jr." → "Julius Walker Jr." so the comma isn't parsed as Last,First; roster first names expanded through the shared nickname table — race rows carry LEGAL names, live-observed "TUBERVILLE, THOMAS H" for roster "Tommy Tuberville"; legislative matches must district-confirm through the committee-search `jurisdiction` join, with missing committee row / missing jurisdiction / district mismatch and unconfirmable same-name rows all failing closed to manual review), `alabamaDirectFinanceAggregator.ts` (Delaware bucket edges; buckets = positive `Cash (Itemized)` minus `Returned (Cash Only)`; coverage cash = signed non-in-kind sum; ratio gates buckets only), `alabamaFinanceWriter.ts` (standard writer, outside replace-to-null, `fcpa_committee_number` backfill helper), auto-link + due list + batch sync (one office fetch and one artifact parse per batch via memoized loaders; auto-link shares the sync flag), `alabamaCandidateFinanceSync.ts` (summary always from the live race row per the Summary-mapping table; bucket window = cached cash artifacts `electionYear-3..electionYear`, never fetched live; any gate failure — missing FCPA number, unreadable artifact, coverage out of band — clears stored buckets and keeps the summary, and a missing race row throws with nothing written), loader `alabamaBallotLookupFinanceLoader.ts` registered in `ballotLookup.ts`, CLIs `alabama-candidates:finance:auto-link` / `:sync-due`. Live read-only smoke 2026-08-28: 5 office labels resolve, race↔committee joins 9/9, 193/193, 4/4, 4/4, 10/10; Tuberville resolves matched (internal 6750, FCPA 31625). 63 Alabama tests.

## Phase 4: live run + prod checklist

Local: link + sync the Nov-2026 statewide slate, spot-check 3 candidates against filing details in the portal UI. Prod: migration, flags in Render env, deploy, then **run the sync directly against production** — per-state finance tables are never promoted (the promote scripts only carry `finance_committee_labels`). Re-sync near November.

## Gotcha bank (carry into implementation)

1. `year` param on race search takes dropdown option ids (1 = 2026), not literal years, and its year attribution differs from extract years — omit it; use the no-year cycle aggregate.
2. Extract download ids: unstable catalog rows, re-read per sync.
3. Cash extract contains in-kind rows — same ids as the In-Kind file; filter by `ContributionType`, don't double-count.
4. `Amended=Y` = current version, keep.
5. Race `COMMITTEEID` (internal) ≠ extract `CommitteeId` (FCPA number) — store both, join via committee search.
6. Financial-summary page: plain internal id (not base64) and unreliable for balances; filing detail is the balance anchor.
7. PCC committee search requires the `committeeType:"1"` criteria row and returns stale registrations — never use it as roster.
8. Ragged CSV lines (~2.5% expenditures file) — tolerant parser, quarantine + count.
9. Extracts regenerate ~02:32 AM CT; race API is live — one-day drift is normal.
10. Municipal: no filing ⇔ possibly ≤$1,000 by law (HB 156) — excluded from v1; if ever enabled, absence must render as unavailable, not $0.
11. TLS incomplete chain — pinned intermediate, verification always on.
12. `Returned (Cash Only)` rows carry POSITIVE amounts; one genuinely negative cash row also exists — handle signed amounts, exclude returned rows from buckets, characterize their effect on `MONETARYCONTRIB` in Phase 0.
13. Malformed-row amounts poison naive sums (they inflated a statewide spend estimate 8×) — quarantine before any aggregation, including in diagnostics.
14. Race rows have no district column — district for legislature/districted courts comes only from the committee-search join (`jurisdiction`); a race query returns all districts of an office flat.

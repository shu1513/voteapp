// Per-state contest-order overrides for the `state_baseline` ballot sort.
//
// Evidence source: docs/research/state-ballot-order.md (the 50-state + DC
// contest-order research campaign). Encoding policy, decided there:
//   - GRADE-A states only. B/C states (PA, ID, MO, AR) keep the generic
//     baseline — their order rests on unverified or conflicting evidence.
//   - DEVIATIONS only: a rule returns a rank ONLY for contests the state
//     provably moves; everything else returns null and falls through to
//     stateBaselineContestRank. States whose verified order matches the
//     baseline get no entry at all.
//   - GENERAL elections only: the research graded general-election order,
//     so overrides fire only when election_stage === "general". Primaries,
//     runoffs, specials, and stage-unknown elections keep the baseline.
//   - Each entry respects its doc entry's GRADE SCOPE: legs the research
//     excluded from A (conflicts, delegation-only, below-tier evidence) are
//     NOT encoded, even when observed practice is consistent.
//
// Grade-A states with NO entry (deliberate — checked against the doc):
//   NY (36)  both in-scope legs match the baseline; the exec-spine leg is
//            A-excluded until a Nov 2026 print exists
//   GA (13)  in-scope leg = judicial absent from November; matches baseline
//   DE (10)  baseline spine exact for every tier Delaware has
//   RI (44)  A scope stops at the state house; local internals excluded
//   CO (08)  retention-block position matches the baseline's late block
//   MS (28)  the early-judicial leg is A-excluded (SOS practice only), so
//            the known-wrong baseline judicial-late stays, per the doc
//   WV (54)  in-scope legs already match the baseline shape
//   ND (38)  the legislature-above-executives inversion sits in the
//            A-excluded intra-party-ladder leg; in-scope legs match
//   AK (02)  office ladder and measures-before-retention both A-excluded
//   KY (21)  all block-POSITION legs graded B (county facsimiles only);
//            the A legs are below tier granularity
//
// Granularity: overrides can only move whole tiers (office scope, judicial
// family + court level, measure district type). Within-tier office ladders
// (executive internal order, county-row sequences, DA/SBOE/township slots
// on unmodeled scopes) are below this resolution and stay unencoded even
// where the doc records them. Title tests are used only where a state's
// tier assignment itself hinges on one (same precedent as
// judicialCourtOffset) and the doc's evidence backs the split.

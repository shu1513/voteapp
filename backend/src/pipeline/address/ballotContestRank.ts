// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// State-baseline contest ranking for the `state_baseline` ballot sort: the
// generic order contests appear on US general-election ballots — federal,
// then statewide, then state legislature, then county, then municipal, then
// school districts, then ALL judicial races as a late block (highest court
// first), and ballot measures last.
//
// Judicial-at-the-end is the majority pattern, not a simplification: every
// retention state prints retention questions as a section after the other
// offices, and the nonpartisan-section states do the same for contested
// judicial races (MN Rule 8250.1810 subp 5 puts Judicial Offices dead last;
// Ohio RC 3505.04 and Michigan's ballot standards put judges on the
// nonpartisan ballot after every partisan office). Placing judges inside
// their level (TX Elec. Code 52.092, NC GS 163-165.6 style) is the minority.
//
// This is an APPROXIMATION of each state's ballot-arrangement law, good
// enough to render a ballot-shaped preview; it is not a per-state statute
// encoding. When a state's real order diverges enough to matter, add a
// per-state override here (keyed by district.state_fips) rather than
// widening the generic tiers — and validate it against that state's current
// official sample ballots, not statute text alone (several states delegate
// detail to secretary-of-state or election-board rules).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Sparse tiers so a future per-state override can slot a contest between two
// generic levels without renumbering.

// the title; everything else shares the tier's last slot and falls to the
// generic title tie-break. (NY's trial-level "Supreme Court" is fine here:
// its scope tier is lower, and within it NY does print Supreme Court
// Justice before County Court Judge.) Fractional on purpose — the offset

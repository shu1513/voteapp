// A county/parish (or city) district row carries every seat attached to it, so

// the jurisdiction — including seats they cannot vote in. The official ballot
// title is stored and rendered verbatim, so the ward IS visible; what is missing
// is any signal that the seat has its own, smaller electorate.
//
// This module extracts that seat designator so the ballot card can SAY SO. It
// deliberately does not filter: the app has no ward/precinct membership for an
// address (the Census geocoder returns voting districts, but no source maps a
// voting district to a justice-of-the-peace ward or a commission district), and
// a badge that claimed to filter would be lying.
//
// It is read-path only. The office matcher's stripSeatSuffixes still collapses
// every seat onto one catalog office — that is by design and is untouched here.

//     Judicial District Court"), not to a seat. 40 live rows.

// Ballot-lookup read side for Austin (plan Phase 3): a thin config wrapper
// over the shared standard-shape loader. Austin deltas: link identity is
// filer_key (no filer id exists), outside tables key on
// spender_key/spender_name (the normalized DCE `paid_by`), and the outside
// totals carry a coverage note because the schema can only hold directed
// spending.
//
// TEXAS_TEC / Houston coexistence: the Texas state loader already skips
// every place-scope "Mayor" / "City Council Member" election (the Houston
// office list), so no tx_ summary can compete with an atx_ one; Houston's
// tables are disjoint from Austin's (different place row, different link
// table). Registered as the third TX adapter.

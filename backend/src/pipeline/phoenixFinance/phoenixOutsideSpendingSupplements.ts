// veto pipeline (a mistyped target simply matches no roster candidate).
//
// Maintenance contract:
// - Add an entry only after reading the filing itself; cite it in sourceNote.
// - `electionYear` is the ELECTION year the expenditure targets (sync's
//   cycle filter key), not the calendar year of the expenditure.
// - `filingReference` uniquely identifies the source filing; one filing may
//   name several candidates (one entry per candidate), never the same
//   candidate twice.

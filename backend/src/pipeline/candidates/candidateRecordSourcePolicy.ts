//
// civoren.com, verified 2026-07-30: its Matthew Smith page states "First
// Elected: 2018", describes "his legislative career", and places him in Battle
// Creek / Calhoun County. Michigan HD 62 is a Macomb County seat (Fraser,
// Harrison Twp, Chesterfield, Clinton Twp, Roseville, St. Clair Shores) held by
// Alicia St. Germaine since 2023; Smith is a challenger who has never held
// office. The page invented a county, a year, and an entire incumbency.
//
// Blocking is citation-only by design. These sites are still worth READING for
// leads: an audit of the 13 stored records that cited civoren found all 13
// claims true once chased to primaries, and one (an insurance career confirmed
// at FL DFS licensee D029506) appeared on no other site. Chase the lead, cite
// the primary.
//
// Second-order reason this class needs a hard block rather than a doc note:
// civoren's robots.txt explicitly Allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot,
// CCBot and Google-Extended. Its pages are built to be ingested by AI systems,
// and a 2026-07-30 web search restated its invented incumbency as fact with no
// attribution — so a researcher can absorb the fabrication without ever
// visiting the domain, and two "independent" summaries can share one poisoned

// South Carolina ballot-lookup finance loader: thin config wrapper over the
// standard loader. Outside totals are never stored (committee filings expose
// no independent-expenditure flag, candidate target, or support/oppose), so
// they surface as null with the coverage note — never $0. The direct note is
// the source-wide static one from the aggregator; the standard family
// persists no per-candidate note (that variant is a sync diagnostic only).

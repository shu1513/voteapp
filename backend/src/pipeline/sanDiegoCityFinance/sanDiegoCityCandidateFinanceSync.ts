// Phase 3 per-candidate sync: aggregate one linked committee's direct and
// outside money from the parsed cycle workbooks, decide quarantine from the
// violation list, build the per-candidate coverage notes, classify employer
// labels (deterministic + cached-manual only — NO classifier is ever
// injected; San Diego finance sync performs zero AI calls), then write one
// all-or-nothing snapshot. Copy-adapted from the San José sync; the SD
// divergences are the two ALWAYS-ON coverage notes:
//
// - direct_coverage_note is never null: San Diego's SDMC $10k threshold means
//   whole committees may legitimately file on paper and be invisible to the
//   e-filing export (plan "Coverage gap"), so every published total carries
//   the e-filed-only disclosure — the SJ no-460 / prior-activity sentences
//   append to that baseline instead of replacing silence.
// - outside_coverage_note is never null (the sdcity_ summaries column shipped
//   for exactly this): the S496 ∪ Schedule-D union basis is disclosed always,
//   and any name-matched rows the office/jurisdiction/district/direction
//   vetoes excluded are disclosed per candidate (the live case: California
//   Working Families Party's pro-Crosby rows carry Dist_No=6 and stay
//   excluded until the Phase 4 PDF check).
//
// Fail-closed contract (the SF pattern): every health-check failure THROWS
// before replaceSanDiegoCityCandidateFinanceSnapshot is called, so the prior
// snapshot survives untouched. A committee that affirmatively reports no
// qualifying data (registered, no Form 460 filings yet) writes a zero
// snapshot with a coverage note instead — "the source says nothing" and
// "the source is broken" are deliberately different outcomes.
//
// Quarantine policy (unchanged from SJ): a violation blocks the write only
// when it makes the published totals untrustworthy —
//   filing_unusable / duplicate_summary_line / missing_summary_line
//     (a filing or core line is excluded or ambiguous, totals incomplete),
//   contribution_reconciliation / loan_cross_check
//     (rows and report covers disagree — canonical selection failed).
// prior_activity_uncovered publishes WITH the coverage note (Martinez's live
// case: his committee opens 2025 with $33.8k of earlier activity the export
// lacks). Everything else — duplicate_period_filings, line_arithmetic,
// period_overlap, period_gap, cash_chain — is diagnostics only.

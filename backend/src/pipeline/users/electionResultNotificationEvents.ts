 * Fans a batch of elections that just received a decisive result out to users
 * who live in the election's district and have the email digest on. The
 * caller (the election-result writer) passes only elections whose freshly
 * written result row has a decisive outcome (won/advanced/runoff for offices,
 * passed/failed for measures) — not_found/not_final_yet/unknown rows never
 * notify. The (user, election) unique constraint makes re-writes (the
 * certified pass after election night, corrections) no-ops, so each user is
 * notified at most once per election. Verified-email filtering happens at
 * send time, not here, so a user who verifies later still gets the alert.

// North Dakota ballot-lookup finance loader: thin config wrapper over the
// standard loader. Phase 2 publishes total receipts, the donor-only "Raised"
// figure and contribution-size buckets; Phase 3 adds filed occupations for
// committees that pass the display gate (the sync stores none otherwise, so
// the card simply has no occupation rows); Phase 4a adds support/oppose
// groups and totals from the IE harvest (NULL when that component was
// skipped, $0 when a clean harvest names nobody). Spending (year-end
// statement only) and cash (statewide filers only, unparsed) are never
// stored yet, so they surface as null with the coverage notes — never $0.

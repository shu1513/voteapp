// georgia_plan.md D6/D12: Georgia discloses no per-target amount on an
// independent expenditure, so a transaction naming more than one target —
// several candidates, or a candidate plus a ballot measure — has no
// defensible split and stays out of the per-candidate totals (49 of 387 IE
// transactions in the 2026 filing-year probe). That is a systematic gap,
// not a rounding error, so it is stated with the totals until the source
// discloses target-level amounts — at which point this note is removed.
// (Malformed rows D6 also quarantines — duplicate or missing targets,
// conflicting stances — are data-quality diagnostics, not a systematic
// gap, and deliberately stay out of this user-facing sentence.)
//
// The second gap (D12b, pinned at the spike): expenditures disclosed only to
// the retired pre-July-2025 filing system carry no target registration id at
// all, so they can never attribute — the IE leg reads the current system
// only. For the 2026-cycle candidates in v1 scope that money is pre-cycle,
// but the note states the boundary honestly.

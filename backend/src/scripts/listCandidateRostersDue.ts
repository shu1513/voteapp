// Read-only work-queue queries for manual candidate-roster research. The
// command reports two intentionally separate queues:
//   - initialPending: upcoming office elections whose generated roster row
//     has never received a research pass, and
//   - due: completed/no-result rosters that need a refresh pass.
//
// A roster is refresh-due when it is
//   - 'no_results' (an earlier pass found no candidates — common early,
//     before anyone has announced), or
//   - 'written' with zero staged candidates in the payload (data debt from
//     before empty AI rosters were staged as no_results), or
//   - 'written' longer ago than the cooldown (a completed roster still needs
//     periodic reconciliation for late entrants near the election).
//
// Emptiness is judged on the staged payload, not on candidate_elections
// links: a written roster with staged candidates but zero links means the
// downstream profile/link fanout never completed — re-researching the roster
// would target the wrong pipeline stage. Those rosters are reported in the
// separate fanout-debt list instead.
//
// Failed rows are repair work, not untouched research. Pending rows with a
// reason, a non-empty staged roster, or any canonical candidate link already
// received work and are excluded from initialPending. Ledger-backed rows also
// received a pass that established a timing blocker. Refreshing far-future
// elections is wasted work — rosters change close to filing deadlines — so
// all lists are capped to elections within the lookahead window.

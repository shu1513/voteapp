// Read-only gap report: primaries whose general was never imported.
//
// Importing a primary without its general leaves the ballot half-blind — the
// Michigan Aug-2026 statewide primaries shipped while the November Governor
// race didn't exist at all, so voters saw who advanced but not the race they
// advanced TO. This report is the standing guard against that pattern: a
// primary implies a later round, so every office-race primary must be
// followed, in the same district and for the same contest, by a later
// election within the horizon. The list of violations IS the to-be-researched
// queue — recomputed from the elections table each run, so a general imported
// through any path clears its gap instantly and a newly imported primary
// surfaces one, with no queue state to drift.
//
// A row leaves the report one of three ways:
//   - the general is researched and imported (manual:elections:inject) — the
//     normal outcome;
//   - research finds the primary legitimately ends the contest (majority-win
//     judicial primaries, charter rules like Honolulu's exactly-two-filers) —
//     record an elections-stage deferral on the primary
//     (manual:deferral:record) and manual:deferral:due owns it from there;
//   - the primary itself was bad data and gets superseded/corrected.
//
// Louisiana November primaries are NOT gaps: the jungle primary IS the
// November election, and its next round (a December runoff) exists only when
// no candidate clears 50%. Those rows are reported in a separate bucket so
// the operator can see them without them drowning the real gaps. The
// carve-out is Louisiana-only and the two queries are exact complements —
// a November or December primary anywhere else still expects a later round
// and stays gap-eligible, and no primary can fall between the buckets.
//
// Contest matching: office_id vouches for a later row only when this
// district+office holds a single primary that day — seat-per-title races
// (city council districts, judicial positions) share one office_id, and one
// seat's general must not clear the other seats' gaps (verified live: Cape
// Coral council districts, WA Supreme Court positions). When sibling
// primaries exist, or office_id is absent, official_ballot_title_key
// identity decides — unless both rows carry offices that disagree, which
// marks different contests sharing a title. Residual: a multi-seat contest
// whose OTHER seats' primaries were never imported has no sibling to betray
// it, so a different seat's general can still clear it; importing the full
// primary set is what closes that hole. Any later same-contest election
// counts — general, runoff, or unstaged — because the report's question is
// "does the next round exist at all", not "is its stage labeled correctly".

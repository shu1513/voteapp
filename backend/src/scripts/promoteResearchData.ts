// so a target-only tag on a record that local still holds is stale by
// construction, not a production-side correction.
//

// reconcilable only when its record's local counterpart is certain: the same
// (candidate, record_identity_key) exists locally, or the record is being
// rekeyed in this run through the transition ledger (the ledger is exact
// provenance, so the tag is re-addressed to the new key and judged there).

// is good enough to avoid inserting a duplicate, but not good enough to
// justify deleting data on its say-so. A target-only record is skipped too —
// it is either a stale duplicate (research:promote:dedupe's job, which removes
// its tags by cascade) or something local never held, and promotion must not

// Guarded single-link move between sibling election shells.
//
// Title-variant duplicate shells (a generic "Governing Board" shell next to
// its per-seat contests, or two spellings of the same contest) leave
// candidate_elections rows pointing at the wrong shell. The election
// injector can never repair that: its upsert identity is
// (district_id, official_ballot_title_key, election_date), so reinjecting
// under the right title creates the right shell but strands the links on
// the wrong one. This wrapper moves EXACTLY ONE explicitly identified link
// to an explicitly identified sibling shell — no heuristics, no bulk mode —
// so an operator can empty a duplicate shell link by link before retiring
// it with manual:elections:supersede.
//
// Guard rails, all of which must pass before a single row changes:
// - the link (candidate, from-election) exists and is row-locked;
// - both elections exist, are row-locked, and share district_id AND
//   election_date (crossing either means this is not a duplicate-shell
//   repair — wrong tool). --allow-cross-district relaxes ONLY the district
//   equality, and only for verified SIBLING districts (same state, related
//   body names, compatible types — assertSiblingDistricts); race_type and
//   election_stage must always match;
// - the target roster must not already list a different candidate id with
//   the same normalized display name (a duplicate PERSON — merge the
//   candidate rows first); first+last-name near-misses are warned on;
// - the from-election has no persisted election_results rows: their
//   winners JSON references candidate_elections ids, which a move or
//   merge-delete would corrupt;
// - no state campaign-finance link rows exist for (candidate, from-election):
//   finance tables denormalize election_id + election_year and their
//   summaries join on the election, so a bare link move would strand them
//   (checked dynamically against every FK table so new finance states are
//   covered automatically);
// - if the candidate is already linked to the target shell, the move
//   converges only when both rows agree on status/is_incumbent/running mate
//   (the from-link is then deleted as a duplicate); disagreeing rows are a
//   research question, not a merge;
// - before that duplicate-merge delete, no rows may reference the from-link
//   id itself: tables that FK onto candidate_elections(id) (e.g.
//   fl_candidate_finance_outside_group_links) carry no candidate_id or
//   election_id of their own, so the election-scoped finance scan above
//   cannot see them, and ON DELETE CASCADE would silently take their rows
//   with the link (checked dynamically against the catalog; FK shapes the
//   check cannot count — composite, or not referencing id — are refused
//   outright);
// - running-mate uniqueness on the target shell is pre-checked so the move
//   cannot trip uq_candidate_elections_election_running_mate_candidate_id;
// - local-database guard, single transaction, --dry-run.

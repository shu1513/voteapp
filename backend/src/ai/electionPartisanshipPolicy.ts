// judge of the court of appeals among the offices whose candidates get "the
// name of the political party by which the candidate was nominated" printed
// under the name. ORC 3505.04 leaves "judges of a municipal court, county
// court, or court of common pleas" on the NONPARTISAN ballot, where "[n]o name
// or designation of any political party ... shall be printed under or after any
// nonpartisan candidate's name" — those judges are nominated at a party primary
// and still appear in November with no party. Forcing every Ohio judicial
// contest partisan rejected the legally correct common-pleas rows on rewrite
// (live 2026-08-08: near-identical common pleas titles stored as both t and f).
//
// Ohio is therefore expressed as nonpartisan-with-two-partisan-titles rather
// than the other way round. Enumerating the lower courts cannot be made safe:
// the probate and juvenile courts ARE divisions of the court of common pleas
// (ORC 2101.01 defines "probate court" as "the probate division of the court of
// common pleas" and its judge as "the judge of the court of common pleas who is
// judge of the probate division"), so a board that titles the contest "PROBATE
// COURT JUDGE, JUVENILE DIVISION" names no lower court a pattern could key on

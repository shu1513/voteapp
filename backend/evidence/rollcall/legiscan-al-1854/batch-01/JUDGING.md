# Alabama 2021 First Special Session batch-01 — judging notes

## Sources

Every measure was judged from the version its chamber actually voted, fetched through the LegiScan bulk
API (`getBillText`, and `getAmendment` for conference substitutes) and verified against the byte length
and MD5 hash the dataset records for that document. The state website was not used: it had been timing
out for hours at a stretch during the previous Alabama batch, and one direct download in that batch
returned HTTP 200 with a truncated, unreadable file.

Alabama prints struck and inserted text together and the conversion flattens both into one run of words.
The convention is struck text first, inserted text second, so `no less than 12 10 months` means the old
law said 12 and the new law says 10. Every changed number in these descriptions was read that way.

## Roll-attribution and date audit

Each imported roll's printed roll call number was checked against its own bill's history, and each
roll's date was checked against the bill history line recording the same action. Results for this
session are in `../survey/divided-worklist.tsv`. The term-level findings, including a case where one
session's dataset carried another session's roll calls, are in
`../../legiscan-al-1756/CODE-FINDINGS.md`.

## Label reasoning

Every stance label states `nay` explicitly, and every one is `null`: in each measure the realistic
reason for a no vote runs on a different axis than the scored area.

- **HB 2 — public_safety_and_crime_control, yes = for.** For sentences of 10 years or more the release
  window narrows from between 12 and 24 months before the end of the sentence to between 10 and 12, and
  everyone released under it wears an electronic monitor at the board's expense.
- **HB 4, HB 5 and HB 6 — general, no stance.** The three money bills: $785 million of bonds, $400
  million of federal pandemic relief, and $154 million of state funds. Using federal pandemic money to
  build prisons drew national attention, so these are high salience, but they are appropriations and bond
  authorisations, and the campaign already treats an appropriations bill as no-stance (HB 125 of 2023).

## Duplicates

A precise sweep found the hand-written records that describe the same votes, and they were retired
before the import. The sweep is restricted to Alabama candidates, an exact vote date, a description
naming the same bill, and a description worded as a vote. It excludes only records whose origin run id
begins `rollcall:`, because hand-written records carry a `manual:candidate-records:...` run id and a
null-check misses them. Sponsorship records naming the same bill were left alone.

## Import and reconciliation

- Real run (stamp `2026-09-03T16:55:11.367Z`): **238 inserts, 0 errors, 0 notified**, across 5 rolls.
- Reconciled three ways: the report totals; the run-stamp predicate (238 rows, 76 distinct
  candidates); and the Alabama roll-call total, which moved from 4,890 to 7,527 across the six batches
  imported together.
- Convergence: a follow-up dry run reports all 238 `unchanged`.

## Writing checks run before import

`candidateRecordPlainLanguageLint`: 0 warnings. Every description is 2 to 4 sentences with no sentence
over 45 words, and a British-spelling scan is clean — it caught real slips on a first pass, including
`legalised`, `licence`, `behaviour`, `labour` and `programme`, all corrected. Reading grade was measured
per session; medians run 8.6 to 11.2.

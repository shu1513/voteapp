// Every page's head tags come from here, for one reason: React Router replaces
// the parent's meta array with the leaf route's, it does not merge them
// ("the entire meta descriptor array is replaced, not merged"). So a route that
// exports meta to set its own title silently drops the description and the
// share-card tags unless it builds the whole set. Routes call pageMeta and get
// all of it.
//
// The share-card tags matter more than they look. The way this app spreads is
// one person sending a link to another before an election, and what that person
// sees is whatever iMessage, WhatsApp, Slack, or Facebook can scrape from the
// server-rendered head. Without og:* they fall back to guesswork and render a
// bare URL — which, for an unfamiliar link about voting, reads as something to
// distrust rather than open.

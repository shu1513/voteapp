        <h2 className="pt-2 text-heading font-semibold">Why do we do what we do?</h2>
        <p>When we go voting, two problems show up:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal space-y-1 pl-6">
          <li>We don’t know if our votes actually matter.</li>
          <li>We don’t know who most of these candidates are.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 className="pt-2 text-heading font-semibold">Do our votes matter?</h2>
        <p>
          In a presidential election, unless we live in a key district in a swing state, our vote is
          one among more than 150 million. But in a city council or school board race, a few hundred
          votes may decide the outcome. Ironically, these local offices could affect our daily lives
          far more.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-2 text-heading font-semibold">Who are these candidates?</h2>
        <p>
          The bigger the election, such as the presidential election, the more media coverage it
          gets. So we know only about the candidates our votes have the least power over, but
          nothing about the candidates our votes matter the most for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The little information we do get about candidates is usually heavily biased with an
          agenda behind it, if not outright marketing or propaganda.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-2 text-heading font-semibold">What {APP_NAME} does</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of {APP_NAME} is to give real track records of candidates based on what they
          actually did, so we can see more clearly who these candidates are, and make a decision on
          who to pick based on the issues that matter to us, not on their ads.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-2 text-heading font-semibold">
          Why must we stay neutral?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because we believe that no single person or small group knows best what everyone else
          should think and do. What I believe is good is not necessarily what is good for you.
        </p>
        <p>Only people themselves can decide what’s best for them.</p>
        <p>So the best thing to do is to lay out the facts so we can decide for ourselves.</p>

        <h2 className="pt-2 text-heading font-semibold">How we do it</h2>
        <p>
          We use multiple American AI models to research public sources and summarize what they
          find (AI never writes content on its own). Then we filter and validate everything across
          different guardrails and models before it’s written, and run quality passes with both
          humans and AI. For full transparency, our source code is open and public{" "}

        <p>
          Keeping this information current (new elections, new candidates, new records) takes
          constant effort from our staff and money for AI usage.

// The draft's finish line (docs/plans/draft-completion-moment.md): one
// notice, shown once per election day, when every race on the nearest
// upcoming day has a pick. Driven by the SAME progress value the header
// counter reads, not by the click that made the last pick — the last pick
// can come from the election page's auto pick, the picks page's batch fill,
// or another tab, and none of those pass through a pick card. Rendered as a
// row of the sticky header, in flow: nothing floats over the candidate
// page's bottom pick card (and its undo control), and no z-index contest
// with the chatbot launcher or the terms gate, which all sit at z-30.
//
// Wording claims only what the counting rule establishes (isDecidedChoice:
// one pick decides a race, even a multi-seat one; a withdrawn pick still
// counts; ZIP/city partial ballots reach 100%): "picks added for every
// race", never "your ballot is complete". No share mention — guests can't
// share, and signed-in users find Share on the date card.
//
// Status message, not a dialog (WCAG 4.1.3): role="status" announces it
// politely, focus stays where the user is — including when completion
// arrives from another tab — and the actions are an ordinary link and a
// dismiss button. The live region container is always in the DOM (empty
// until it fires) so screen readers pick up the insertion.

// Routes where the draft itself is on screen (or nothing is): the notice
// never renders there, and a completion that happens there (batch auto
// fill on /me/picks) counts as seen — it is not queued for the next page.

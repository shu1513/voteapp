/**
 * Cloudflare Worker: path router for electionssimplified.com.
 *
 * Implements the reverse-proxy split from docs/deploy-checklist.md on
 * Cloudflare instead of a self-managed proxy: /api/* and /sitemap.xml go to
 * the API service, everything else to the SSR server. Both origins are the
 * services' public *.onrender.com hosts (Render routes by Host header, so
 * the upstream URL's hostname is all that changes).
 *
 * Client IP: Cloudflare sets CF-Connecting-IP on every proxied request and
 * always overwrites a client-supplied copy, so its value is trustworthy at
 * this hop — but the servers must NOT read it directly. Both origins sit
 * behind Render's own Cloudflare, which rejects (403) outside clients that
 * present the reserved CF-Connecting-IP header — and would overwrite it with
 * the sender's socket IP even if it let the request through — so the SSR
 * loader could never relay that header to the API's public host. This
 * worker therefore copies the value into the custom X-Voteapp-Client-IP
 * header (CLIENT_IP_HEADER below), which passes through Render's edge
 * untouched; both servers read it via
 * ADDRESS_API_TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER=X-Voteapp-Client-IP.
 *
 * Worker vars (set in the dashboard or wrangler.toml):
 *   API_ORIGIN — e.g. "voteapp-api.onrender.com"
 *   SSR_ORIGIN — e.g. "voteapp-ssr.onrender.com"
 *
 * Both must be BARE hostnames. They are validated, not trusted: assigning an
 * invalid value to url.hostname is a silent no-op per the URL spec, so an
 * unvalidated "https://host" or "  " would leave the public hostname in
 * place and make the Worker fetch its own URL instead of failing.
 *
 * Route: electionssimplified.com/* and www.electionssimplified.com/* (www 301s to
 * the apex so the canonical origin matches SITE_ORIGIN and robots.txt).
 *
 * Every response — proxied, redirect, or error — is stamped with the
 * baseline security headers (SECURITY_HEADERS below); neither origin sets
 * them, and note direct *.onrender.com responses bypass this stamping.

// proxied record on the zone; skip `preload` so the commitment stays
// revocable.
//
// CSP ships Report-Only first: violations surface in the browser console
// without ever blocking a resource. There is deliberately no report-uri
// yet, so "observation" means the operator browsing the site with devtools
// open — adequate at this traffic level; when a Sentry DSN goes live, add
// its security-report endpoint as report-uri to collect real-traffic
// violations before promoting to enforcing Content-Security-Policy.
// Inventory behind the policy (2026-07): every loaded resource is
// same-origin (no fonts/analytics/CDN; external URLs in the app are plain
// hyperlinks). connect-src allows *.sentry.io because the frontend ships
// dark Sentry support (VITE_SENTRY_DSN, errorMonitoring.ts) — enforcing
// without it would silence error reporting the day the DSN is set.
// 'unsafe-inline' is required in script-src because React Router SSR
// hydrates via inline scripts (dropping it needs nonce plumbing between
// this Worker and the SSR origin), and in style-src for React inline style
// attributes. Browsers ignore frame-ancestors in Report-Only mode; it's
// staged here for the enforced policy, and X-Frame-Options DENY covers
// framing today.
// The accounts.google.com sources are Sign in with Google (GIS): the button
// script, its styles, the credential iframe, and its status requests —

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- cache ----
// Edge caching for public pages: the SSR loaders on these routes are
// anonymous by design (personalization happens client-side after hydration
// — see frontend/src/pages/CandidatePage.tsx), so their HTML is identical
// for every visitor and safe to share from cache. The origin can't declare
// this itself: react-router-serve serves prerendered HTML with max-age=0
// and SSR responses with no Cache-Control at all, so the Worker owns the
// policy. Mechanism notes, learned the hard way:
//   - Zone Cache Rules never apply: Workers run before the zone cache, and
//     the subrequest goes to the *.onrender.com host, which zone rules
//     never match.
//   - fetch cf options (cacheEverything/cacheTtlByStatus) are silently
//     ignored here too: the *.onrender.com upstream sits on ANOTHER
//     Cloudflare account's zone (Render's), and a Worker can only drive its
//     own zone's cache — verified empirically 2026-08-07 (no CF-Cache-Status
//     on subrequests, no latency change).
//   - So the Worker uses the Cache API (caches.default) explicitly: match
//     by public URL, store only status-200 cookie-free responses with
//     s-maxage. Per-colo cache (each Cloudflare datacenter holds its own
//     copy) — exactly what spike absorption needs.
//
// Eligibility is deliberately narrow, all four conditions required:
//   GET + SSR-bound + allowlisted path + no session cookie on the request.
// The allowlist keeps /me/*, /picks/:token (token-authorized content),
// auth/token pages, and the 404 catch-all out of cache — the last also
// stops random-URL requests from filling the cache. The cookie gate means a
// logged-in user's request is never even cache-eligible, so a response

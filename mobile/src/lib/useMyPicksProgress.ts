/**
 * The saved-ballot header's pick counter ("My Draft 4/13" → "My Picks ✓"):
 * progress over the nearest upcoming election day, the same denominator as
 * that day's card on the My Draft screen. Null hides the counter (logged
 * out, unverified, ballot not loaded, no upcoming races, or choices still
 * loading). Mobile counterpart of the web's useMyPicksProgress.
 *
 * Same key AND url as the My Draft screen's ballot query, so opening that
 * screen from the header is ONE shared request — in paper-ballot contest
 * order (explicit sort + followed_first so the user's saved list
 * preferences never apply there). Deliberately NOT the ["me", "ballot"]
 * key: the saved-ballot tab owns that one with the user's saved sort — but
 * the shared ["me", "ballot"] prefix means address-change invalidations
 * refresh both. No include=preview: that include exists for the web's
 * ballot-sheet view; mobile has no such view yet.

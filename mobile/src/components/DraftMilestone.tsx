// Mobile port of the web's DraftMilestone (docs/plans/
// draft-completion-moment.md, section 2): the My Draft screen's finish
// line, above the date cards, once every race on the nearest upcoming
// election day has a pick — and shown ONCE per day per device (owner's
// rule: persistent = nag). Same counting rule as the card's "N of M races
// decided" line (isDecidedChoice) and the same one-line wording as the
// notice. The seen state is read on each focus (AsyncStorage, async) and
// held, so the box stays for this visit even though it marks the day right
// away; the next focus finds the marker and shows nothing. Marking also
// covers the notice's scope, so the pick screens' one-time notice never
// fires for a day read about here. No sign-up link: mobile has no guest
// draft.

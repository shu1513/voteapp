// Mobile port of the web's DraftCompleteNotice (docs/plans/
// draft-completion-moment.md): one notice, once per election day per
// device, when every race on the nearest upcoming day has a pick. Driven by
// the same progress value the saved-ballot header counter reads — a known
// incomplete → known complete for the SAME tracked ballot (identity + day +
// race list); null is "unknown", never "incomplete", so a returning user
// whose first resolved value is already complete gets nothing.
//
// Mounted in flow at the top of the two screens where picks are made (the
// election and candidate screens), above their ScrollView and never over
// their pick footer — the same "root View + siblings, no absolute overlay"
// rule those screens follow. Per-screen instances, not a root-layout
// overlay: RN has no shared header row to ride, and the notice belongs on
// the screen where the last pick landed. Screens beneath the focused one
// stay mounted in a native stack (election → candidate), so only the
// FOCUSED instance may fire and announce; the others just keep their
// baseline current. Losing focus retires the notice; the My Draft screen's
// milestone (DraftMilestone) is the persistent one.
//
// Wording (owner's call, same as the web): "You have completed your {day}
// draft." plus the link, nothing else. Status message, not a modal: polite live
// region on Android, an explicit VoiceOver announcement on iOS, focus and
// scroll position untouched.

## Description (both stores)

Elections Simplified shows you the full ballot for your address — every
race, every candidate, every ballot measure — and explains it in plain
language.

For each candidate you get a short, neutral summary plus a record of what
they have actually done: votes cast, bills sponsored, positions taken, and
campaign finance where it is public. No spin, no ads, no political
organization behind it. Elections Simplified is independent and ad-free.

- Enter your address once and see the races you can vote in.
- Read plain-language candidate profiles and records.
- Mark your picks race by race and keep a private ballot draft.
- Follow candidates and get a notification when their record changes.
- Share a pick card with friends — only if you choose to.

Your picks are private. We never sell data, show ads, or share your choices
with campaigns.

## Apple App Privacy questionnaire

| --------------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |

| Name (first name)           | Yes       | Yes            | No                | App functionality                |

| Precise location            | No        |                |                   |                                  |
| Purchases                   | No (payments happen on the website, not in the app) | | | |

"Used for tracking" is **No** for everything: no advertising, no cross-app
tracking, no data brokers.

## Google Play Data safety form

- Does the app collect or share user data? **Yes, collects; does not share**
  (processors under contract do not count as sharing).
- Is data encrypted in transit? **Yes** (HTTPS only).
- Can users request deletion? **Yes** — in-app (Settings → Security → Delete
  account) and by email to contact@electionssimplified.com.
- Data types: Personal info → Email address, Name. Personal info → Other
  (picks, follows, interests). Device or other IDs → push notification token.
  App info and performance → Crash logs.
- Purpose for each: App functionality; Account management (email, name).
- Optional vs required: all collected data is optional (the app works without
  an account for browsing the ballot).

## Review notes (Apple) — demo account

> Elections Simplified is a independent voter-information app. Browsing works
> without an account: enter any U.S. address (for example, 1600 Pennsylvania
> Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500) to see a ballot. To review signed-in
> features (picks, follows, notifications) use:
>
> Email: `<create a dedicated reviewer account in production>`
> Password: `<password>`
>
> Notifications are sent when a followed candidate's record changes; this can
> take days, so there may be none during review. The app makes no purchases;
> support payments happen on the website only.

## Google Play closed testing

Google requires a closed test with at least 12 opted-in testers for 14
continuous days before a new personal developer account may publish. Set up
the test track as soon as the account is verified, invite testers by email
list, and keep the same build live for the full 14 days.

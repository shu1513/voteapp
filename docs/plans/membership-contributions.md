# Membership & one-time support payments

Let signed-in users support the app with a custom monthly membership or a one-time payment — both minimum $5, both capped at $1,000 per transaction (the cap is shown in the UI when exceeded, not silently rejected). Every dollar is recorded in our own database: who paid, how much, when, and refunds. Stripe handles all card data; we store references only.

Not a nonprofit. UI copy must say the money supports operating the service — never candidates, campaigns, committees, parties, or charities — and must never claim charitable deductibility. Brand in UI copy is **Elections Simplified** (VoteApp is the internal repo name). Use "support" / "supporter" / "membership" in customer-facing copy — avoid "contribution"/"donation", which read as political/charitable in this product. No content is ever gated behind membership; perks are recognition only (out of scope for v1).

## Stripe facts this plan relies on (verified 2026-08-21)

- Checkout `custom_unit_amount` (pay-what-you-want prices) is **one-time only** ([docs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pay-what-you-want)). Custom monthly amounts instead use inline `price_data` with a dynamic `unit_amount`, which works in both `mode: "payment"` and `mode: "subscription"` (`recurring: {interval: "month"}`). One mechanism for both flows: user types a dollar amount in *our* UI, backend creates the session. Server enforces minimums.
- Webhook signature verification (`stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`) needs the **exact raw request body** — add an `express.raw` branch for the webhook path ahead of `createJsonBodyParser()` (already path-scoped).
- Stripe **does not guarantee webhook event order** and retries failed (non-2xx) deliveries for up to ~3 days ([docs](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)). Handlers must be idempotent and must not trust event arrival order for state.
- The SDK's pinned API version does **not** pin webhook payload shapes — the webhook endpoint's own configured API version controls those ([versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning)). Pin the endpoint version when creating it (prod checklist): set it to the exact `YYYY-MM-DD.codename` version the installed SDK pins (printed in the stripe-node release notes; not the npm package number).
- Stripe-hosted customer portal gives cancel + card-update UI; its **defaults allow customers to edit email/name and switch plans** — configure it explicitly ([portal config](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/configure-portal)).
- Fees 2.9% + 30¢ per domestic card charge → a $1 payment loses ~33% to fees. Hence $5 minimum on one-time too (~9% at $5).
- SDK: `stripe` npm package v22.x.

## Account-deletion constraint (drives the schema)

Account deletion is a **hard delete** — `DELETE FROM users` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` on every user-owned table ([authService.ts:1275](backend/src/auth/authService.ts#L1275)), promised by the privacy policy. So:
- Payment history must NOT reference `users.id` directly: a `NOT NULL` FK would block deletion; a cascade would erase accounting records we are legally required to keep.
- Solution: a `billing_customers` indirection row. On account deletion its `user_id` is set NULL — payment records survive as accounting data unlinked from any account (amounts, dates, Stripe refs; no name/email in our DB). Be precise about what this is: the retained Stripe ids can still be resolved to a person through the Stripe dashboard, so these rows are **pseudonymous business records, not anonymous data** — retained under the accounting/tax/legal basis the privacy policy §4 states, accessible only to whoever holds DB + Stripe credentials (the operator). Never call them "anonymized".
- Deletion flow must **cancel any nonterminal subscription first** — any Stripe status other than `canceled`/`incomplete_expired`, since even an `incomplete` one can still activate within its 23-hour window (Stripe would otherwise keep charging a card for a deleted account) — then let `user_id` null out. Cancellation is a **precondition**: if the Stripe cancel call fails, the delete request fails with a retryable error ("couldn't cancel your membership — try again in a few minutes") and no DB rows are touched. This keeps the Terms §14.3 promise ("deleting your account cancels any active membership") true without building a retry queue — the user retries, and cancel is idempotent, so the cancel-succeeded-but-delete-failed half-state is harmless (the retry's re-cancel is a no-op). Users with no live subscription (the vast majority) are unaffected.

## Data model — migration 250 (next free number at write time)

```sql
-- Indirection that survives account deletion.
CREATE TABLE billing_customers (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid UNIQUE REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,  -- nullable

    amount_cents integer NOT NULL CHECK (amount_cents > 0),
    currency text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'usd',
    kind text NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('one_time', 'monthly')),
    stripe_payment_ref text NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- payment_intent id (one-time) or invoice id (monthly)
    -- Always populated, for both kinds: refund events identify a
    -- charge/payment_intent, never an invoice, so this is the join key for
    -- refunds. One-time: same value as stripe_payment_ref. Monthly: resolved
    -- at insert time via the invoice's payments (expand `payments` on the

    -- itself was removed in 2025-03-31+ API versions); our invoices are
    -- Checkout card subscriptions paid in full by one payment, so expect

    stripe_payment_intent_id text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    refunded_amount_cents integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
        CHECK (refunded_amount_cents >= 0),
    refunded_at timestamptz,
    CHECK (refunded_amount_cents <= amount_cents),
    paid_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX billing_payments_customer_paid_at_idx
    ON billing_payments (billing_customer_id, paid_at DESC);

-- One row PER SUBSCRIPTION, append-only across a customer's lifetime: a
-- cancel + resubscribe adds a row, never overwrites one. This is what
-- preserves consent evidence — CA BPC §17602 wants consent verification
-- retained ≥3 years (or 1 year past termination), and a single

CREATE TABLE billing_subscriptions (
    stripe_subscription_id text PRIMARY KEY,
    billing_customer_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES billing_customers(id),
    -- Consent evidence pointer (CA auto-renewal law): the Checkout Session
    -- that carried the renewal-terms consent checkbox. Stripe retains the

    stripe_checkout_session_id text,

    -- email (renewal terms + how to cancel) was sent. NULL = not yet sent;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX billing_subscriptions_one_live_per_customer_idx
    ON billing_subscriptions (billing_customer_id)
    WHERE stripe_status NOT IN ('canceled', 'incomplete_expired');
```

- "Is this user a paid member" = join through `billing_customers` to the customer's nonterminal subscription row where `stripe_status IN ('active', 'past_due')` (`past_due` keeps member treatment during the retry window; everything else — `canceled`, `incomplete`, `unpaid`, etc. — is not a member). Raw status is stored verbatim so new Stripe statuses never break the schema.
- `stripe_payment_ref UNIQUE` = idempotent ledger writes under webhook retries (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- Totals shown to users = `SUM(amount_cents - refunded_amount_cents)` (net).
- All identifiers ≤ 63 chars.

## Backend

New module `backend/src/api/membership/` (service + helpers), wired through `AddressApiServerOptions` like existing features (see `getAuthenticatedEmailPreferences`: option injected in `runAddressApiServer.ts`, handler in `apiServer.ts`). Stripe client injected at the service boundary so tests mock it without network.

### Endpoints

First three: `requireVerifiedAuthenticatedUser` + JSON-parser path list. Webhook: public predicate list, signature-verified, raw body, **exempted from the global per-IP rate limiter** (`app.use(createRateLimitMiddleware…)` applies to every path and buckets by IP — Stripe's shared delivery IPs would 429 under the 60/min default).

1. `GET /api/me/membership` — `{ enabled, stripeStatus, monthlyAmountCents, cancelAtPeriodEnd, currentPeriodEnd, totalNetCents, payments: [...latest 50] }`. When Stripe isn't configured returns `{ enabled: false }` (frontend hides the whole section — no broken UI, no separate feature flag).
2. `POST /api/me/membership/checkout` — body `{ kind: 'monthly' | 'one_time', amountCents }`.
   - Validate: integer; ≥ 500 both kinds; ≤ 100_000 (=$1,000 card-testing cap — raise later if a real supporter asks).
   - Monthly while a subscription row is in a live status → 409 (amount change = cancel in portal, resubscribe; portal plan-switching is disabled).
   - Get-or-create `billing_customers` row + Stripe customer, then create the session:
     - `line_items[0].price_data`: `{currency: 'usd', product: STRIPE_MEMBERSHIP_PRODUCT_ID, unit_amount, recurring?}`; one dashboard-created Product shared by both flows.
     - `payment_method_types: ['card']` — cards only in v1, so no async-payment-method events (`checkout.session.async_payment_*`) to handle.
     - `customer`, `client_reference_id` = billing_customer_id; `metadata: {billingCustomerId, kind}` on the session, mirrored into `payment_intent_data.metadata` (one-time) / `subscription_data.metadata` (monthly). Internal billing id in metadata, never raw user id.
     - `success_url`/`cancel_url` → settings page `?membership=success|canceled`.
     - `expires_at` = 30 minutes (Checkout's minimum) — a stale tab can't complete a forgotten session hours later.
     - Monthly only — **California auto-renewal consent (BPC §17602)**: `consent_collection.terms_of_service: 'required'` plus `custom_text.terms_of_service_acceptance.message` stating, next to the unchecked box, the selected amount, that it renews monthly until canceled, and that cancellation is available anytime in account settings, with a link to the Terms. The completion handler verifies `session.consent` is present and stores the session id on `billing_subscriptions.stripe_checkout_session_id` — Stripe retains the session with its consent record, which is the retained proof §17602 wants. A completion arriving **without** consent (should be impossible — Stripe enforces `required`) fails closed: cancel the subscription and record its canceled state, because continued billing without retained consent evidence is exactly what §17602 forbids; the already-charged first month is refunded manually, like the guard cancels. (Requires the Terms URL configured in the Stripe dashboard's public details — rollout item.)
   - Frontend disables the button while the request is in flight (double-click guard); a rarer cross-tab race is closed by the webhook guard below. A user who deliberately completes checkout twice has genuinely paid twice: the guard cancels the second subscription's future charges, and its already-charged first month is refunded manually from the dashboard (visible in the ledger).
3. `POST /api/me/membership/portal` — portal session, `return_url` → settings. 404 without a billing customer.
4. `POST /api/stripe/webhook` — verify signature; response policy:
   - `400`: bad signature/payload.
   - `2xx`: event ignored, or DB transaction committed.
   - `5xx`: transient DB/internal failure → Stripe retries (this is the delivery guarantee; "always 200" would silently drop payments).
   Events:
   - `checkout.session.completed` (`mode: payment`) → insert ledger row (`one_time`, ref = payment_intent).
   - `checkout.session.completed` (`mode: subscription`) → **fetch the subscription from Stripe and upsert `billing_subscriptions` keyed by subscription id** from that current state (no ledger row here — first month's row comes from `invoice.paid`; writing it in both places double-counts). A resubscribe therefore adds a new row; old rows are never touched (consent history).
   - **Membership-started acknowledgment email** (§17602's retainable post-purchase acknowledgment — a Stripe receipt alone doesn't carry cancellation policy): when a subscription row first reaches a live status and `acknowledgment_sent_at IS NULL`, send one SES email (existing mailer infra) stating the monthly amount, that it renews monthly until canceled, how to cancel (settings → Manage membership), and linking the Terms; then stamp `acknowledgment_sent_at`. On a failed send the column stays NULL and the webhook fails retryably (5xx) — Stripe redelivers that event with backoff for days, and any later subscription poke also retries, so the legally required notice never depends on a future event happening to arrive. A send that succeeded but failed to stamp may re-send on retry; a rare duplicate acknowledgment beats a lost one.
   - `customer.subscription.created` / `.updated` / `.deleted` → same treatment: the event is a poke, the fetched subscription object is the truth. This makes out-of-order delivery harmless — every handler writes current reality, not the event's snapshot.
   - `invoice.paid` (subscription invoices, amount > 0) → ledger row only (`monthly`, ref = invoice id). Never flips membership status — status recovery arrives via its own `subscription.updated` event.
   - `charge.refunded` (the **only** refund event we subscribe to) → find the ledger row by the charge's `payment_intent` and **set** `refunded_amount_cents = charge.amount_refunded` — Stripe's cumulative figure, an absolute assignment, never an increment. That one choice makes the handler idempotent under retries, correct for partial refunds, and self-correcting when a pending refund later fails (a `refund.created` handler would count refunds that never succeed, and listening to two refund events would double-apply). `refunded_at` = first time the value goes above zero. Not subscribed: `refund.created`/`refund.updated`/`refund.failed` (all folded into the charge's cumulative number) and `invoice.payment_failed` (status arrives via `subscription.updated`). Disputes: log + handle manually in the dashboard (volume will be ~0).
   - Duplicate-subscription guard: on subscription upsert, if the billing customer already has a **different** live subscription id, cancel the newly arrived one via API and log — closes the concurrent-checkout race without reservation machinery.
   - Deleted-account guard: on any subscription upsert where the billing customer's `user_id IS NULL` (account already deleted — e.g. a checkout tab completed after deletion), cancel the subscription at Stripe immediately. Same one-line check closes the deletion↔checkout race without deletion-pending states or locks. A one-time completion for a deleted account just records its ledger row (no recurring harm; refund manually if the person asks).
   - Unknown event types → 200 + log. Unmatched `charge.refunded` (no ledger row for its `payment_intent` yet — delivery order isn't guaranteed, the refund can arrive while `invoice.paid` is still retrying) → **5xx**, so Stripe redelivers until the ledger row exists; every charge on this account comes from our checkouts, so it always eventually matches.

### Email-change integration

Stripe locks an existing customer's email in Checkout and sends receipts to it, so the customer object must track the account email. After a verified email change commits, `authService.verifyEmailChange` calls a best-effort membership hook that pushes the new address via `customers.update` — a Stripe failure warns and never fails the committed change (checkout/portal keep working; the dashboard can fix a stuck address). Subscription events are additionally ownership-checked against `STRIPE_MEMBERSHIP_PRODUCT_ID` before any record or guard-cancel, so the guards can only ever touch membership subscriptions.

### Account-deletion integration

In `authService` deleteAccount, before `DELETE FROM users`: look up the user's billing customer; if a nonterminal subscription exists (any Stripe status except `canceled`/`incomplete_expired`), cancel it at Stripe (immediate, not period-end). Stripe failure → the delete request fails with a retryable error and nothing is deleted (see the deletion-constraint section: cancellation is a precondition, cancel is idempotent, so retrying is always safe). On success, `billing_customers.user_id` nulls via FK.

### Config

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_MEMBERSHIP_PRODUCT_ID` (`.env.example` + render.yaml `sync: false`).
- Presence of `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` turns the feature on; startup then **fails fast if the other two are missing, if no site origin is set, or if no mailer is configured** (the §17602 acknowledgment email is a legal requirement of taking the first subscription, so Stripe-on/mailer-off is partial config = crash at boot, not 500s at runtime). All absent = feature cleanly off (per feature-flags policy: money features default off).
- New dependency: `stripe` (backend only). No frontend Stripe SDK — Checkout and portal are full-page redirects.

### Backend tests

- Checkout validation (mins, cap, kind, non-integer); 409 while live subscription.
- Webhook: bad signature → 400; DB error → 5xx; each event type; duplicate delivery no-ops; out-of-order subscription events converge (fetch-current makes this trivial); subscription-mode completion writes no ledger row; `charge.refunded` re-delivery and partial refunds land on the same cumulative value; `charge.refunded` before its ledger row exists → 5xx, then succeeds once `invoice.paid` lands; duplicate-subscription guard cancels the newcomer; deleted-account guard (`user_id IS NULL`) cancels a post-deletion subscription; subscription completion without `session.consent` cancels the subscription and records it canceled; a subscription on a different Stripe product is ignored (no record, no guard cancels); email-change sync pushes the new address to `customers.update` and a Stripe failure never fails the change; resubscribe after cancel creates a second row and leaves the first row's consent pointer intact; acknowledgment email sent once, failed send → retryable 5xx and the stamp stays unset; a consent-less completion for a different Stripe product cancels nothing; checkout for an existing customer refreshes the Stripe customer email first.
- Deletion: active member delete cancels subscription and nulls `user_id`; Stripe failure → delete request fails, no rows deleted; retry after successful cancel completes the delete.
- GET totals = net of refunds.

## Frontend

"Support Elections Simplified" section on [SettingsPage.tsx](frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx), existing useQuery/useMutation card pattern. Hidden entirely when `enabled: false`.

- Non-member: support pitch + two dollar inputs/buttons ("Become a monthly supporter — $5/month minimum", "One-time support"). Copy (final legal review in rollout phase): *"Elections Simplified is independently operated. Optional payments support operating the service — not any candidate, campaign, committee, party, or charity. Payments provide no additional content or influence and are not eligible for a charitable-contribution receipt."*
- Member: "Monthly supporter — $X/month since {date}"; if `cancel_at_period_end`, "ends {current_period_end}"; net total supported; "Manage membership" → portal. `past_due` → fix-payment nudge (portal link).
- Payment history (latest 50, no pagination v1).
- `?membership=success` → thank-you banner + refetch ("may take a moment to appear" — webhook lag; no polling).
- Whole-dollar input, cents conversion client-side, min **and $1,000 max** enforced both ends with a visible message when exceeded; buttons disabled in flight. Frontend tests cover both boundaries ($5 min, $1,000 max).

Frontend tests: hidden-when-disabled, three states render, min validation, redirect on checkout response.

Mobile: out of scope v1. (Apple's external-purchase rules now vary by region — US allows external-purchase links with conditions; don't add any mobile surface without a per-region guideline check.)

## Phases

1. **PR 0 — legal**: privacy policy (name Stripe as a third party in Section 3; amend Section 4: payment records are retained, unlinked from the deleted account, for accounting/legal compliance) + terms of use (payments/subscription/refund/cancellation section). Small doc-only PR, merges first — the retention promise must change before any payment exists.
2. **PR 1 — backend**: migration 250, `stripe` dep, service, 4 endpoints, deletion integration, rate-limiter exemption, wiring, tests. Inert without env keys.
3. **PR 2 — frontend**: settings section + tests.
4. **Rollout** (no PR): Stripe live account — confirm account classification for voluntary support payments with Stripe ([their tips/donations requirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/requirements-for-accepting-tips-or-donations)); create Product; restricted API key; webhook endpoint subscribed to exactly these six events — `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`, `charge.refunded` — and **pin its API version to the SDK's pinned version**; configure portal explicitly (payment-method update + invoice history + period-end cancel ON; email/name edits + plan switching OFF); set the Terms of Use URL in the Stripe dashboard's public business details (required before `consent_collection.terms_of_service: 'required'` works); enable Stripe email receipts for recurring charges (each names the amount and our contact; the settings-page portal link = §17602's required easy online cancellation); enable Stripe's failed-webhook email alerts; set 3 env vars in Render (manual sync approve); apply migration 250 (prod script-file pattern); test-mode E2E first, then live $5 → verify ledger row → refund it → verify net total drops to $0 → cancel → delete a test account while subscribed.

## Deferred with a deadline (not optional)

**Annual renewal reminder (CA BPC §17602, as amended by AB 2863 eff. 2025-07-01).** Don't confuse the two notice provisions: the 15–45-day pre-renewal notice applies only to initial terms ≥ 1 year (not us), but the AB 2863 **annual reminder** applies to automatic-renewal/continuous-service offers generally — month-to-month included (product, charge amount + frequency, how to cancel). A monthly Stripe receipt is a payment record, not that reminder. Nothing is owed until a membership approaches one year old, so v1 ships without it — but a simple SES email to active members (we already send account email via SES) **must ship within 12 months of the first membership**. Track it as a follow-up the moment the first member subscribes.

## Explicitly out of scope (v1)

Perks/badges/supporters page; dispute automation (manual); anonymous or logged-out payments; amount change without cancel+resubscribe; non-USD; mobile; pagination; a `stripe_webhook_events` inbox table and a scheduled reconciliation script (revisit if volume or audit needs grow — at launch scale, idempotent handlers + Stripe's dashboard event log + failed-delivery alerts cover it).

# Roll-call vote import (bill → legislators → candidate records)

Status: research + design, 2026-08-22. No code yet.

## Idea

Today records are found per candidate (one search per person). Flip it: take one
roll-call vote, which already lists how every member of a chamber voted, judge
that ROLL CALL once (what it decided, which research area, which way is "for"),
then fan that judgment out to every member who is already a candidate in our
DB. One judgment → up to 435 records. Dedupe against the candidate's existing records
before writing.

## What the DB already has (verified 2026-08-22, local)

- `candidate_records` columns: `candidate_id, description, source_url, event_date,
  record_identity_key, origin (ai_enricher|repair|manual), origin_run_id,
  retired_at, retired_reason`. Unique on `(candidate_id, record_identity_key)`
  where the key = md5 of normalized `source_url | event_date | description`
  (`backend/src/pipeline/candidates/candidateRecordStore.ts:143-156`).
- Labels live in `candidate_record_area_tags (record_id, research_area_id,
  stance for|against|NULL)`; 27 slugs in `db/seeds/research_areas_v1.sql`
  (e.g. `womens_reproductive_rights`, `gun_control`, `immigration`). Federal
  offices use an 18-slug subset.
- Writer: `upsertCandidateRecords` — same candidate + same date + same URL +
  description token-F1 ≥ 0.86 → update in place; else insert. Manual CLI:
  `npm run manual:candidate-records:write --records-file --labels-file`.
- Source policy: any `*.gov` is auto-listed; `legiscan.com`, `openstates.org`,
  `govtrack.us`, `votesmart.org` are on the founding allowlist; `voteview.com`
  is not (unlisted = still accepted unless damaging-claim pattern).
- Candidates carry NO bioguide / OpenStates / LegiScan ids. Only `fec_ids`,
  `state_filing_ids`, `current_office` (free text like `PA State Representative`),
  `has_held_public_office`. Districts are named
  `State House District 83 (2024); Texas` / `Congressional District 7 (119th
  Congress), Massachusetts`, with `geoid_compact` (`48083`, `2507`).
- Nov-2026 candidates with `has_held_public_office`: us_house 118,
  state_upper 563, state_lower 2,094 (33 states). US Senate incumbents sit under
  `statewide`.
- 448 live records across 84 candidates already cite
  `clerk.house.gov/evs/<year>/rollNNN.xml` or
  `senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/.../vote_CCC_S_NNNNN.htm` — written
  by hand through the skill. Note they mix `.htm` and `.xml` URLs, so URL-based
  dedupe alone will miss them.

## Sources (verified first-hand unless noted)

### US House — use Clerk static XML (primary)

- Index: `https://clerk.house.gov/evs/<year>/ROLL_<000|100|200|...>.asp` (one
  row per roll: number, date, bill, question, result).
- Vote: `https://clerk.house.gov/evs/<year>/roll<NNN>.xml`. Fields:
  `rollcall-num, legis-num (e.g. "S 1582"), vote-question ("On Passage"),
  vote-type (YEA-AND-NAY, RECORDED VOTE, QUORUM, 2/3 ...), vote-result,
  action-date ("17-Jul-2025"), vote-desc ("GENIUS Act")`, then 435
  `<recorded-vote><legislator name-id="A000370" party="D" state="NC">…</legislator><vote>Aye|No|Yea|Nay|Present|Not Voting</vote>`.
  `name-id` = bioguide id. Plain curl, no key, no block, validator-reachable.
- Backup / richer metadata: Congress.gov API `/v3/house-vote/{congress}/{session}`
  and `/…/{roll}/members` (bioguideID, voteCast, voteParty, voteState,
  legislationType/Number, voteQuestion, amendment fields). ChangeLog says the
  beta label was dropped (the endpoint doc page is stale and still says beta
  / 118th–119th only); live list counts returned votes for the 115th–117th —
  probe coverage per Congress before any historical expansion.
  No date filter — iterate congress/session/roll. `format=json` must be passed
  (default is XML). 5,000 req/hour per key; keys already in main `backend/.env`
  (`CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY_1/2`). `congress.gov` blocks the record validator, so
  never use it as `source_url` — cite the Clerk XML (which is exactly the
  `sourceDataURL` the API itself returns).

### US Senate — senate.gov LIS XML (only structured source)

- Menu per session: `https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_<congress>_<session>.xml`
  (659 votes in 119-1; each has `vote_number, vote_date, issue (S.5 / PN373 /
  H.R.1), question, result, title`).
- Vote: `https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote<congress><session>/vote_<congress>_<session>_<NNNNN>.xml`
  → 100 `<member>` rows with `last_name, first_name, party, state,
  vote_cast (Yea|Nay|Not Voting|Present), lis_member_id (S370)`.
- Congress.gov API has NO Senate vote endpoint (`/senate-vote/119/1` → 404,
  checked Aug 2026). Senate rolls can still be DISCOVERED per bill through
  `/v3/bill/{congress}/{type}/{n}/actions` → `recordedVotes[].url`, which
  points at the senate.gov XML above.

### Federal member crosswalk — `unitedstates/congress-legislators`

- `https://unitedstates.github.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.yaml`
  (+ `legislators-historical.yaml`). Per person: `bioguide, lis, govtrack,
  opensecrets, votesmart, fec[], ballotpedia, wikidata, icpsr`, plus `terms[]`
  with `type, start, end, state, district, party`. CC0. Actively maintained
  (commits 2026-08-19).
- This gives: bioguide ↔ LIS id ↔ FEC id. Our `candidates.fec_ids` is the hook
  for an exact match. Name + state + district is never an auto-attach path;
  it only feeds the manual-resolution report (see Design §2).

### Bill meaning (what the vote was about)

- Congress.gov API `/v3/bill/{congress}/{type}/{number}` (+ `/summaries`,
  `/subjects`): title, CRS summary, `policyArea`, legislative subjects. This is
  the best plain-English source for the description and the research-area
  label.
- Voteview `https://voteview.com/static/data/out/rollcalls/H119_rollcalls.csv`
  has `vote_desc, vote_question, bill_number, clerk_rollnumber` per roll (JSON
  variant adds `crs_policy_area`), and `members/HS119_members.csv` maps
  `icpsr → bioguide_id` (554/555 rows; better than congress-legislators, whose
  `icpsr` is empty for all 79 freshmen). Near-live, 1789–present, citation
  only, no license page. Join on `clerk_rollnumber`, NOT `rollnumber`
  (cumulative across the Congress). Good cross-check / backfill index.

### Dead / avoid

- ProPublica Congress API: shut down 2024-07-10, no new keys.
- GovTrack: bulk data ended 2017; `https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/vote` still
  answers but is unsupported AND `govtrack.us/legal` forbids using its data
  "for the development of any software program" — do not use, even as a
  cross-check. (Its founding-allowlist entry is fine for hand-cited URLs only.) `unitedstates/congress` scrapers (CC0, last commit
  2025-10) still produce vote JSON for both chambers if we ever want a mirror.
- govinfo / GPO: no roll-call collection at all (BILLSTATUS XML only indexes
  `recordedVotes`).
- Ballotpedia: bot-blocked, paid API; human cross-check only.
- VoteSmart: API alive but skill already found service-period and
  identity-contamination bugs in its key-vote archive.

### State legislatures

Two aggregators cover all 50 states; only ~10 states publish real
machine-readable per-member votes themselves.

Official state sources with per-member votes (all probed live 2026-08-22):

| State | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VA | `https://lis.blob.core.windows.net/lisfiles/20261/VOTE.CSV` | Best in country. Floor + committee, member codes `H0386`,`Y/N/X`; joins to `Members.csv`. No auth. |
| WA | `https://wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov/LegislationService.asmx/GetRollCalls?biennium=2025-26&billNumber=1240` (integer) | Per-member `MemberId`; element misspelled `<VOte>`; use plain GET not SOAP. |
| OR | `https://api.oregonlegislature.gov/odata/ODataService.svc/MeasureVotes` (+`CommitteeVotes`) | OData JSON; `VoteName` abbreviated string. |
| NJ | `https://pub.njleg.gov/votes/A2026.zip` | Daily zipped CSV, 1988–present, `Full_Name`, `Legislator_Vote`. |
| OH | `https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/api/v2/general_assembly_136/legislation/hb96/actions/` | Verified: each action has `yeas[]`/`nays[]` of lpids like `sen_wilson_steve_1`; floor + committee; undocumented, no auth, trailing slash required. |
| GA | `http://webservices.legis.ga.gov/GGAServices/Votes/Service.svc` | SOAP, numeric member ids; https times out. |
| CA | `https://downloads.leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/pubinfo_daily_Mon.zip` (both `pubinfo_<Day>.zip` and `pubinfo_daily_<Day>.zip` are listed) | `BILL_DETAIL_VOTE_TBL` one row per legislator, last-name join only. |
| NY Senate | `https://legislation.nysenate.gov/api/3/bills/2025/S1` | Free key; `memberVotes` with permanent `memberId`; Assembly NOT covered. |
| MA Senate | `https://malegislature.gov/api/GeneralCourts/193/Branches/Senate/RollCalls/5` | House roll calls = journal pages, no API. |
| MN House | `https://www.house.mn.gov/Votes/Details?SessionKey=302&BillNumber=HF1486` | HTML; Senate = journal PDFs only. |
| IN | `https://api.iga.in.gov/2026/rollcalls` | UNVERIFIED: needs emailed token; payload shape unknown. |

Structured-HTML scrape tier: WI, NC, OK, TN, FL House, PA, MI (journal HTML),
CO (vote pages, surnames only). PDF-only: MD, CT, KY, LA, NM, SC, IA, KS, FL
Senate, IL, TX. TX/PA/KS/MD/UT have APIs or bulk files with tallies but no
member positions. Stable numeric member ids exist only in VA, WA, GA, NY
Senate, OR; everywhere else = surname matching (`Bell, C.` / `Bell, K.`).

- **Open States / Plural** (`https://v3.openstates.org`, OpenAPI at
  `/openapi.json`). `GET /bills?jurisdiction=…&include=votes,actions,abstracts`
  → `VoteEvent {motion_text, motion_classification[], start_date, result,
  counts[], votes[{option, voter_name, voter{id,name}}]}`. Person ids are
  `ocd-person/<uuid>`; `https://data.openstates.org/people/current/<st>.csv` is
  public (no login) with `current_district, current_chamber, current_party,
  wikidata`. All 53 jurisdictions have VoteEvent code in the scraper repo, but
  completeness varies by state (report card: points deducted "often for roll
  call votes"; HI and MN flagged for no stand-alone roll calls). Public domain.
  Free key = 250 req/day (api-v3 `auth.py`; docs say 500 — treat 250 as
  real), 20 bills/page → API is useless for bulk; session CSV bulk needs a
  login (`vote_people.csv` has `voter_id`; the JSON export DROPS it); monthly
  `pgdump` at `https://data.openstates.org/postgres/monthly/` is ungated
  (~10 GB). Scrapers repo: 50 jurisdictions emit per-person votes; AK, MN, SC
  tallies only. Project alive but thin (Plural bought by SAI360 2025-12;
  public bill pages turned off 2026-01). `motion_classification` is
  near-useless: 31 scrapers hardcode `passage` on every vote.
- **LegiScan** (`https://api.legiscan.com/?key=…&op=getRollCall&id=…`).
  `getRollCall` → `date, desc, yea/nay/nv/absent, passed, chamber, votes[{people_id,
  vote_id, vote_text}]`; `getPerson` → `name, party, role, district ("HD-030"),
  votesmart_id, ballotpedia, opensecrets_id, followthemoney_eid`; `getBill` →
  `title, description, status (4 Passed, 5 Vetoed), progress[], history[]`,
  `votes[]` summary. Free public key: 30,000 queries/month; weekly bulk ZIP
  datasets per session (`getDatasetList`/`getDataset`) cover every getBill /
  getRollCall / getPerson payload, so the free tier is enough if we use bulk.
  Covers all 50 states + Congress (`US`). Bulk datasets are licensed
  **CC BY 4.0** (stated on `legiscan.com/datasets`); API page says data may
  power commercial/public products. No "list roll calls for a session" op —
  roll-call ids come from `getBill.votes[]`, so use the weekly bulk ZIP rather
  than walking bills by API. `getPerson` has no bioguide id (bridge federal via
  `votesmart_id` → congress-legislators). Citing a
  `legiscan.com/<ST>/rollcall/<bill>/id/<n>` page as `source_url` is fine
  (domain is allowlisted).
- LegiScan details that matter: `vote_id` 1 Yea / 2 Nay / 3 NV-abstain /
  4 absent-excused (absent vs excused collapsed); `getPerson` returns CURRENT
  party/district → store per-session snapshots from the dataset, never join
  a 2019 vote to today's district; `desc` has no convention (`Read 3rd
  time`, `House Passed`, `Passage: House Vote #243`, `FP`, TX = bare
  `RV#105`) so final-passage detection = per-state regex + compare `total`
  to chamber size (12 votes in a 100-seat chamber = committee). `description`
  is a real synopsis only in some states (MD, VA yes; CA, GA, TX = legal
  title) — allowlist per state. Weekly national bulk refresh ≈ 230 of the
  30,000 free monthly queries. Paid: Pull $1k (1 state) → $6k (50+), Push
  $2k → $12k/yr.
- Recommendation: LegiScan bulk datasets as the spine (uniform schema, roll
  calls everywhere they exist, CC BY 4.0); Open States people YAML (CC0,
  `ocd-person` ids survive chamber/district changes; bridge to LegiScan via
  `votesmart_id`) as the identity layer; VA `VOTE.CSV` + WA `GetRollCalls`
  as ground truth to validate the classifier; official state bill pages as
  the `source_url` where the skill already proved them validator-reachable
  (`capitol.texas.gov`, `leginfo.legislature.ca.gov`, …; for Michigan the
  skill cites `michiganvotes.org` — a Mackinac Center project, NOT official —
  only because `legislature.mi.gov` fails the validator's TLS check), else
  the `legiscan.com/<ST>/rollcall/...` page. BillTrack50 ($5k/yr, only
  vendor with published price + documented vote endpoints, 24h cache rule)
  is the fallback if we'd rather not maintain ingestion.

### Governors

No vote to import. Structured equivalent = bill signings / vetoes:
Open States action classifications `executive-signature`, `executive-veto`,
`executive-veto-line-item`, `became-law` (signature OR inaction — ambiguous);
LegiScan `status 5 = Vetoed`, history text `"Vetoed by Governor"`. Neither
names the governor → join on state + date against our own governor roster.
Best official feeds: WA (`GetLegislationGovernorSigned/Veto/PartialVeto`
SOAP), NY (`legislation.nysenate.gov` JSON with `signer`), CA
(`VETO_MESSAGE_TBL` in leginfo bulk). Treat as a later phase.

## Design

Review unit = ONE ROLL CALL, not a bill. A bill gets many materially
different votes (rule, amendment, recommit, passage, concurrence, conference
report, override) on different text versions. Bill metadata (title, CRS
summary, policy area) is fetched once into a reusable dossier; the judgment
(sentences + labels) is made and approved per roll call. "One AI call per
bill" is only a cache, never the correctness boundary.

### 1. Pick the votes (queue, then judgment)

The skill's rule stands: "the test is the ITEM, never the tally". So do NOT
import every roll call. Regex builds a queue; it never decides truth.

1. Pull the index (House ROLL_*.asp / Senate vote_menu / LegiScan bulk).
2. Narrow final-action patterns → queue. Measured on House 2025 rolls 1–362:
   98 `On Passage`, 79 `On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass[, as Amended]`,
   49 amendment, 42 `On Agreeing to the Resolution` (39 of them H.Res =
   mostly special rules for debate), 33 previous question, 29 recommit.
   - House keep: `On Passage`, `On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass`
     (+ `, as Amended`), `On Motion to Concur in the Senate Amendment`,
     `On Agreeing to the Conference Report`, `On Passage, Objections of the
     President Notwithstanding`. Default-exclude: everything on H.Res /
     H.Con.Res (`On Agreeing to the Resolution` is usually a rule), amendments,
     previous question, recommit, table, adjourn, quorum, Speaker election.
   - Senate keep: `On Passage of the Bill`, `On the Joint Resolution`, `On the
     Conference Report`, `On Overriding the Veto`. Default-exclude: cloture,
     motions to table/proceed, nominations (`PN…`), S.Res.
   - States (LegiScan `desc` / Open States `motion_text`): per-state regex
     for third reading / final passage / concurrence / override.
   - Committee votes are rejected BEFORE the queue via `is_floor_vote` on
     `legislative_votes`, derived per source: House/Senate XML are floor-only
     by construction; OH actions carry `cmte_name`; VA `VOTE.CSV` and WA
     `GetRollCalls` mark committee rows; LegiScan has no flag, so there
     `is_floor_vote` comes from the `desc` regex plus `total` vs chamber
     size, and anything unresolved stays `null` = excluded, not queued.
   - Exceptions (an impeachment H.Res, a war-powers H.Con.Res, a named
     nomination) enter only by explicit hand add, never by regex.
3. Drop trivia from the queue: post-office namings, commemoratives,
   suspension bills with no policy area of interest.
4. Judgment per roll call, written by the operator (the Claude session
   working with the user — no AI provider call; see Decisions 2026-08-23)
   from the bill page / CRS summary + exact question + voted text version:
   the yea sentence, the nay sentence, research-area slug(s), and which
   option = `for` per slug (yea ≠ `for` by default — depends on the slug's
   goal). Recorded in `judgments.json` under the run's evidence dir and
   applied with `rollcall:judge`, which stores them on the
   `legislative_votes` row.
5. Review per roll call before fan-out (a bad template replicates ×435):
   exact question + version, source excerpt or CRS summary, both sentences,
   every label/stance, a sample of resolved identities
   (`rollcall:resolve`). The judgments file carries the decision
   (`review_status`: `approved` / `pending`); the committed file is the
   review artifact.

### 2. Resolve members to candidates

- Federal: `legislators-current.yaml` + `legislators-historical.yaml`
  (pin the commit sha per run) → bioguide / LIS → `fec[]` → exact match on
  `candidates.fec_ids`. Local check 2026-08-22: 118/118 House and 32/32
  Senate Nov-2026 officeholders carry `fec_ids`, so exact-only is viable.
  Verify chamber, state, district, and that the vote date falls inside a
  `terms[]` window. Name/state/district matching produces a manual-resolution
  REPORT only; nothing auto-attaches on a name.
- State: LegiScan `getPerson` (`district "HD-030"`) / Open States people CSV
  → state + chamber + district number (parsed from `State House District 83
  (2024); Texas`) + name tokens; confidence threshold; below it → report.
  No new id table in phase 1 (`fec_ids` suffices federally). Add a
  `candidate_external_ids (candidate_id, scheme, identifier, jurisdiction,
  valid_from, valid_to, source)` table only when state imports start.
- Only candidates on a Nov-2026-or-later election are in scope.

### 3. Generate + dedupe + write

- Description per roll call, two variants (no name in the text). The opener
  follows the question class, not a generic "voted for": `Voted to pass
  <bill id>, the <short title>, which <one-line effect>…` / `Voted against
  passing…`; `Voted to concur in the Senate amendment to…`; `Voted to adopt
  the conference report on…`; `Voted to override the veto of…`; suspension
  votes read as passage. Tally closes the record: `It passed/failed the
  House/Senate <yeas>-<nays>.` Past tense, ≤ 2 sentences, no modals (quality
  gate rejects `future_promise`). Say "passed the House", never "became law",
  unless the bill was enacted. Omnibus votes get only the dominant slug(s),
  not every provision. `Not Voting` / `Present` rows are skipped.
- `source_url` = Clerk XML / Senate XML / state roll-call page; `event_date` =
  vote date. One URL per record is the existing contract, and the roll-call
  page proves the decisive claim (how the member voted). The "which
  <effect>" clause is therefore kept to the bill's official title / CRS
  summary gist — nothing a reader could not confirm from the bill itself —
  and the bill page URL lives on `legislative_votes.bill_url` for audit,
  exactly as the 448 existing hand-written roll-call records already do.
- Dedupe key = candidate + event_date + normalized bill id (`H.R. 3746`,
  `HR3746`, `H.Res. 863`, `S. 5`, `SB 5`) + question class, scanning live
  records on that date (URL compared with `.htm`↔`.xml` folded). Exactly one
  old row ↔ exactly one new roll call → duplicate. Anything else (several
  roll calls on the same bill and date matching one old row, OR one roll
  call matching several old rows on that candidate) → ambiguous → report, no
  write.
- Duplicates are REWRITTEN IN PLACE, not retired + reinserted. Migration 202
  defines retirement as "the claim was wrong"; migration 209 exists precisely
  for in-place rekeys that keep the row id, tags, and notification history
  (`user_candidate_follow_notification_events` FKs onto the record). The
  importer OWNS this update — it cannot go through `upsertCandidateRecords`,
  whose `findSimilarExistingRecord` requires an identical normalized URL
  (only trailing slashes stripped), so a `.htm`→`.xml` rewrite would insert a
  second row; and its transition reason is hardcoded `research_refresh`. So:
  `UPDATE … WHERE id = <matched record id>` setting `description`,
  `source_url`, `record_identity_key`, `origin`, `origin_run_id`; replace its
  area tags; `recordIdentityTransition(reason = 'rollcall_normalization')` —
  all in one transaction. Same end result the user wants (uniform wording +
  labels), no audit break. Pilot dry-run lists every match first;
  `--skip-existing` flag keeps old rows untouched.
- Notifications: `writeManualCandidateRecords.ts` calls
  `createCandidateRecordUpdateNotificationEvents` for every inserted record,
  and nothing downstream filters on `event_date`, so a 117th-Congress
  backfill would email followers about years-old votes. The importer
  notifies only for inserts whose vote date is within the last 30 days
  (new roll calls); backfill inserts and in-place rewrites never create
  notification events.
- Writer: a small dedicated importer (`src/scripts/importRollCallVotes.ts`),
  reusing the validator, label checks, `upsertCandidateRecords`, and the
  transaction pattern from `writeManualCandidateRecords.ts` — which is
  one-candidate-one-election per invocation and stamps manual provenance, so
  it cannot be the bulk path unchanged. New provenance value
  `origin = 'rollcall_import'` (migration widening the CHECK in 197, plus the
  `CandidateRecordOrigin` TS union) and transition reason
  `'rollcall_normalization'` (added to `RecordIdentityTransitionReason` in
  `candidateRecordStore.ts`);
  `origin_run_id = rollcall:<jurisdiction>:<chamber>:<session>:<roll>:<ts>`.
  Fan-out is atomic and idempotent per roll call; re-running an approved
  roll call writes nothing new.

### 4. Data model (phase 1)

```
legislative_votes
  jurisdiction, chamber, session (congress+session or state session)
  roll_number, vote_date, measure_id, exact_question, voted_text_version
  is_floor_vote (null = unknown = excluded)
  result, yeas, nays
  display_url, machine_url, bill_url, source_sha256, fetched_at
  yea_description, nay_description, labels_json
  review_status (pending|approved|rejected), reviewed_at
  importer_version
  UNIQUE (jurisdiction, chamber, session, roll_number)
```
Member rows are not stored. The fetched XML and the run report (resolutions,
skips, ambiguities, failures) go under `backend/evidence/rollcall/<run-id>/`
and are committed, like the other research campaigns' evidence ledgers. The
importer runs from a developer machine against the local DB (prod gets rows
via `research:promote`), so Render's lack of a persistent disk is not in
play; git is the durable store.

### 5. Phases

1. **Federal pilot**: 10–20 hand-picked 119th-Congress roll calls, clear
   final passage, mostly single-policy bills or CRA resolutions, both
   chambers, exact FEC matches only, Nov-2026 scope, dry-run before every
   write. Measure: match precision, unresolved rate, duplicate-detection
   precision, human rejection rate, label disagreement rate, re-run
   idempotency.
2. **Federal expansion** 119th → 118th/117th for candidates whose service
   overlaps.
3. **State pilot: Ohio.** Has Nov-2026 races (103 incumbents locally), an
   official JSON API with per-member floor + committee votes as ground truth
   (`…/legislation/<bill>/actions/` yeas/nays lpids, verified), and LegiScan
   as the spine. Not Virginia: its legislature has NO Nov-2026 election (odd
   years; 0 VA state incumbents in the Nov-2026 set). Not TX/PA: PDF-only,
   surname matching — the hardest case first.
4. **State rollout** across the 33 states with Nov-2026 incumbents.

Out of scope: voice votes (unrecorded), committee votes, amendment votes,
nominations, and governor sign/veto actions — the latter is a different
importer with different evidence (see "Governors" above for sources).

## Decisions (2026-08-22)

- One judgment per ROLL CALL (originally planned as a guarded AI run;
  superseded 2026-08-23, see below). Look at each roll call's two sentences
  + labels before fan-out.
- Duplicates of the 448 hand-written roll-call rows: replace — done as an
  in-place rewrite (row id kept, transition logged), not retire + reinsert.
- Review unit = roll call; federal matching = exact FEC id only; state pilot
  = Ohio; governors = separate future importer (2026-08-22 review).
- Judgment + review (PR 5, 2026-08-23): no AI provider call. The operator
  (Claude session + user) is both judge and reviewer, so the judgment pass is
  a committed `judgments.json` applied by `rollcall:judge`, not a guarded
  run. Each judgment names the measure and vote date it was written about,
  checked against the row under lock, so a mistyped roll number that lands
  on another roll call is refused. An approved row whose judgment changes
  is moved back to pending, rewritten, and re-approved in one transaction
  (the only path the freeze trigger allows); the next `rollcall:import`
  rewrites the fanned-out records in place. Approved → pending is refused
  once records have fanned out (the importer never withdraws records):
  replace the judgment, or retire the records first.
- Duplicate scan (PR 4, 2026-08-23): an old row is a duplicate only when its
  `source_url` IS this roll call (Clerk XML, Clerk vote page, Senate
  .htm/.xml — `rollCallUrlKey` folds them). The "bill id + question class"
  key was dropped: a free-text description has no reliable question class,
  so a same-day recommit vote on the same bill would have been rewritten
  into a passage record. Same-day rows that name the measure without citing
  the roll call (press-release citations) are listed in the report as
  `relatedRecordIds` for a human and never written.
- Pilot follow-ups (PR 6, 2026-08-23): the duplicate match also folds the
  Clerk's MemberVotes search page (roll number is exact within the
  date-scoped scan); `relatedRecordIds` additionally lists same-day
  vote-claim rows from non-roll-call sources (the pilot's press-release
  misses named neither a bill id nor the feed's title — the Clerk prints
  "One Big Beautiful Act", the Senate title is just "S. 5, As Amended");
  and a retired row blocks a candidate only when no live row carries the
  vote, so retiring a redundant duplicate copy does not freeze the live
  record.

## Decisions (2026-08-23, phase 3)

- Ohio pilot runs on the OFFICIAL Ohio LIS API directly, not LegiScan: no
  key or account needed, `state.oh.us` is listed by the source policy, and
  the cited feed itself carries the per-member votes. LegiScan stays the
  plan of record for the phase-4 rollout. Code: `rollcall:oh:fetch` /
  `rollcall:oh:resolve` / `rollcall:oh:import` (+ state entries in the
  shared `rollcall:judge` judgments format).
- Ohio has no roll numbers → surrogate `roll_number` = the vote action's
  `occurred` timestamp in epoch seconds (deterministic, unique per chamber,
  int4-safe until 2038); the fetcher refuses collisions and refuses two
  kept floor votes of one chamber on one bill and day, because the per-bill
  actions URL is the source_url and could not tell them apart.
- State identity layer = a committed per-GA crosswalk file
  (`evidence/rollcall/ohio-136/crosswalk.json`), lpid → candidate id, the
  review artifact playing the role of exact FEC ids. `rollcall:oh:resolve`
  proposes pairs by strict name matching (report-only); a human decides
  what enters the file; the importer attaches only what the file says. The
  `candidate_external_ids` table waits for the multi-state rollout.
- Committee-ness comes from Ohio's structured action codes, never
  `cmte_name` (a conference-report floor vote carries the conference
  committee's name). Unknown vote-bearing codes classify `is_floor_vote =
  null` and are surfaced, never queued.
- Judgment grounding for Ohio = the LSC Final Analysis PDF (CRS analog)
  from the bill page's Documents tab; the two-sentence + labels + review
  flow is unchanged.

## Decisions (2026-08-24, phase 4 code)

- Phase-4 spine = LegiScan bulk datasets, as recommended above, read from an
  EXTRACTED dataset directory. No live-API code: bulk is the plan of record,
  no key exists yet, and untestable download code would ship unverified. The
  operator downloads the session ZIP (legiscan.com/datasets, or
  `getDatasetRaw` with a key once registered) and unzips it; the fetcher
  routes files by their envelope key (`bill` / `roll_call` / `person`),
  never by archive layout. Schema pinned against the LegiScan API User
  Manual v1.91 (rev 2025-03-17); every read field re-checked at parse time.
  Code: `rollcall:legiscan:fetch` / `rollcall:legiscan:resolve` /
  `rollcall:legiscan:import` (+ registry states accepted by the shared
  `rollcall:judge`).
- `roll_number` = LegiScan `roll_call_id` (real, globally unique, int4-safe);
  `session` = LegiScan `session_id` as a string; `source_url` = the per-roll
  page `legiscan.com/<ST>/rollcall/<bill>/id/<roll_call_id>` from the bill
  feed's own `votes[].url` (constructed fallback), which names exactly one
  vote — so none of Ohio's surrogate-roll or same-day-collision machinery
  carries over. legiscan.com now sits behind a Cloudflare challenge (403);
  the record validator explicitly allows 403, verified end-to-end.
- Which descriptions are final-action floor votes is a PER-STATE fact:
  `legiscanStateConfigs.ts` is a registry (jurisdiction, pinned session_id,
  chamber sizes, kept/excluded desc regexes) that ships EMPTY. A state is
  added only after `--survey` (config-free desc histogram per chamber with
  tally ranges) has been read — patterns are measured, never guessed.
  Committee-ness: kept desc + total ≥ 60% of chamber = floor; unknown desc +
  total < 50% = committee (rejected before the queue, counted); everything
  between classifies `is_floor_vote = null` — stored and surfaced, so a
  state that lists only voting members cannot lose a floor vote silently.
  Kept instrument types = LegiScan `bill_type` B / JR / JRCA / CA.
- Identity layer = a committed crosswalk file keyed by `people_id`, pinned
  to the jurisdiction only (people_id is stable across sessions, unlike
  Ohio's per-GA lpids). The proposer keeps the Ohio name rules
  (last-name tail + first exact-or-prefix, unique both directions) and adds
  `seatAgrees` (member's `HD-063` vs the candidacy's district) as reviewer
  information — a mismatch flags, never vetoes, since a member may be
  running for another seat. LegiScan's `last_name` is a clean field, so the
  Ohio pilot's `"Hall, D."` blind spot does not carry over. The importer
  runs off committed files alone: evidence dir + crosswalk + the people
  snapshot `legiscan-people-<st>-<sessionId>.json` that resolve writes.
- Smoke-tested 2026-08-24 on a synthetic one-bill dataset against the local
  DB: fetch (inserted → unchanged on re-run), judge (approved through the
  registry gate), import dry-run + real (transaction, sha pin, live
  sentence validation of the legiscan.com URL, zero records for an
  all-null crosswalk), then the row deleted and the temp config removed.

## Decisions (2026-08-29, stance + review-gate fixes)

Driven by defects the records-quality campaign found in fanned-out rows
(GA SB 40 / PA HB 103 chip sweeps, GA HB 1247 title-vs-text cluster,
ND SB 2377 committee-name subject):

- **Nay stance is authored, never inverted.** `labels_json` elements are now
  `{slug, yea, nay}`. The old fan-out inverted the yea stance for nay voters
  (`flip()`), but a no vote on one bill is not the opposite stance on the
  area's whole goal — it rendered as "Opposes <Area>" chips that two manual
  sweeps had to remove. On a stance area, `nay: "for"|"against"` is the
  stance a no vote actually evidences; `nay: null` means nay voters get NO
  tag on that slug (silence, not the opposite claim; untagged records are an
  accepted state). Non-stance areas tag both sides topically as before.
  `rollcall:judge` refuses a new stance label without an explicit `nay`;
  stored pre-`nay` rows read as `nay: null`, so the next `rollcall:import`
  of such a roll call drops the flipped stance tags rather than re-minting
  them — the deliberate repair path, run per roll call, never automatically.
- **Tally gate.** Approving a judgment requires both sentences to cite the
  row's own `<yeas>-<nays>` (the closing tally sentence was already the §3
  template; now it is enforced). Catches sentences written about a different
  stage of the same bill and mistyped tallies.
- **Superseded-stage gate.** A roll call cannot be approved while another
  kept floor vote (`is_floor_vote = true`) on the same measure in the same
  chamber and session sits in `legislative_votes` on or after its date —
  same-day peers count (reconsider-and-revote pairs share a date and the
  sources give no within-day order), and the scan stays inside the bill's
  session since measure numbers repeat across sessions (US scans both
  calendar sessions of the Congress) (PA HB 103: first passage 148-55 was
  fanned out while the members' final position was the 201-2 concurrence
  that became Act 28). Judge the chamber's final action; to approve an
  earlier stage on purpose, list the later roll numbers under
  `acknowledge_later_rolls`. Limit: the gate only sees fetched rows — fetch
  the bill's full vote list before judging (LegiScan bulk gives it for
  free; federal, walk the bill's actions).
- **Authoring rules that stay human** (not mechanically checkable; the
  materiality-regex experiment false-positived 50/54 rows, so no wording
  pattern checks): (1) describe provisions from the text actually voted on
  (the PN/engrossed/enrolled version in `exact_question`, or the enacted
  act), never from the bill's TITLE — GA HB 1247's title read as a
  permission ("may act as authorizing agencies") while the enacted text is
  a mandate ("shall be required to participate"), replicated to 188 rows;
  verify may/shall against the operative text before writing. (2) Never
  infer a bill's subject from the COMMITTEE that handled it — ND SB 2377
  sat in a human-services committee but amends the insurance code; the
  subject comes from the bill text/analysis. (3) Existing rule restated:
  the sentences describe THIS roll call's question, and multi-stage bills
  get the final action.
- Committed pre-gate `judgments.json` files no longer re-apply verbatim:
  the file parse now demands explicit `nay` on every stance label. Add the
  `nay` fields (usually `null`) to re-apply one; a judgment that then
  matches the stored row byte-for-what-it-means is still `unchanged` (the
  apply-time gates run only when something would change).
- Fan-out `refresh` action (2026-09-04): the record identity key does not
  cover the description, so an edited `yea_description` / `nay_description`
  re-imported over an old row used to come back `unchanged` and keep the
  stale text (seen on DE batch-01: 33 rows patched by hand). The plan step
  now compares the stored description and source_url with the incoming
  ones; a same-key row that differs is `refresh`, which updates
  description, source_url, and updated_at on that row (same id, tags, and
  notification events) and is counted separately in the import report.
  `--skip-existing` still only guards hand-written rows.

## Open questions

- Register a free LegiScan API key (needed to download the phase-4 bulk
  datasets; the user must create the account).
- LegiScan ToS read-through before redistributing raw dumps (data itself is
  CC BY 4.0).

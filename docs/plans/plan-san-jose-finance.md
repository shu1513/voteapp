# San José Local Campaign Finance Plan

Status: Phases 1–5 built (shared `efileCalFinance/` client + parser, the San
José eligibility + resolver adapter, the direct/outside aggregators — all
live-verified 2026-08-10 — then migration 233 + flags + source enum + snapshot
writer, then the Phase 5 sync/auto-link/batch/loader/CLI, dry-run verified
live 2026-08-11); Phase 6 live validation done locally 2026-08-12 (real writes,
all six candidates reconciled cent-exact against every filed 460 PDF), to be
re-run after the city's final candidate list (Aug 13) before production.
Feasibility + export semantics verified against live
data 2026-08-10 (portal probed, 2025+2026 workbooks downloaded and audited).

## Goal and v1 scope

Per-candidate finance summaries for San José city offices, same card the other
city modules feed: total raised, total spent, top donor occupations/employers,
contribution size buckets, and outside spending for/against. v1 targets the
November 3, 2026 runoff (verified on the city 2026 election page: **Council
Districts 5, 7, 9 only** — mayor is presidential-cycle since 2024). Never
hardcode districts: sync is gated to OUR November-election roster candidates
(city finalizes its candidate list August 13).

Candidate qualification comes from OUR rosters (manual research), never
inferred from filings — the filing store also contains withdrawn, terminated,
prior-cycle, and non-city committees (verified: "David Cohen for California
Senate District 10 2026" files copies with the city).

## Proven source access (all verified live 2026-08-10)

- Official portal `https://efile.sanjoseca.gov` (vendor efile.systems), live
  since 2025-12-18. Old SouthTech portal retired **February 2026** — never
  build against it.
- Bulk export API (no auth):
  `GET /api/v1/public/campaign-bulk-export-url?year=<Y>&most_recent_only=<bool>`
  → returns a stable unsigned S3 URL, e.g.
  `https://efs-efile-campaign-exports.s3.amazonaws.com/csj/export/City_of_San_Jose_CAL_2026_most_recent.xlsx`.
  Years 2018–2026; recent 3 years refresh hourly. 2026 file ≈ 2.6 MB.
- Filing-metadata API: `GET /api/v1/public/campaign-search?...` → per-filing
  JSON: `state_id` (FPPC ID), committee `name`, `committee_type`, amendment
  chain (`amends_orig_id`, `amendment_number`), `e_filing_id`.
- Workbook (CAL 2.20 data, XLSX): **15 sheets, NO cover/CVR sheet** —
  `F460-Summary`, `F460-A-Contribs`, `F460-C-Contribs`, `F460-B1-Loans`,
  `F460-D-ContribIndepExpn`, `F460-E-Expenditures`, `S496`, `S497`, etc.
  Occupation/employer present (`Ctrib_Occ`/`Ctrib_Emp` on A and C sheets).
- Amendment semantics verified: the `most_recent_only=true` ("without amended
  records") variant keeps only current versions (superseded originals absent;
  e.g. Bien Doan filing 24690 replaced by amendment 24692).
- Backend already has the `xlsx` dependency; no new packages.

## Export semantics (audited — these are load-bearing)

- `F460-Summary` rows key on **(Form_Type, Line_Item)** — never a bare line
  number. `Form_Type=F460` line 2 = net loans; `Form_Type=A` line 2 =
  unitemized monetary < $100; `Form_Type=C` line 2 = unitemized nonmonetary.
- `Amount_A` = this report period; `Amount_B` = **calendar-year-to-date** (not
  cycle-to-date). The 2026 campaign contribution period began **November 4,
  2025**, so a 2026 cycle needs the **2025 + 2026** files summed.
- Form 460 line 5 includes loans (line 2). VoteApp keeps loans out of
  `total_raised` (`loans_received` is separate in
  `ballotLookupFinanceShared.ts`), so line 5 is NEVER mapped to total_raised.
- Filed arithmetic can be internally wrong: Bien Doan's current 2026 460
  reports YTD line 1 = 91,178.91, line 2 = 20,000.00, but line 3 =
  131,178.91 — a $20,000 overstatement baked into the filing. Invariant
  checks are mandatory, not nice-to-have.

### Cycle formulas (verified against live data)

Across canonical, non-overlapping, current-version F460 filings whose periods
fall inside the campaign period (2025-11-04 → runoff, spans calendar years):

- `total_raised` = Σ(F460 line 1 `Amount_A`) + Σ(F460 line 4 `Amount_A`)
  (monetary + nonmonetary, loans excluded)
- `loans_received` = loan-receipt lines of the B1 summary block (exact
  (Form_Type, Line_Item) pinned in Phase 1 fixtures), cross-checked against
  the `F460-B1-Loans` sheet
- `total_spent` = Σ(F460 line 11 `Amount_A`)
- `cash_on_hand` = latest filing's F460 line 16 `Amount_A`
- `debts_owed` = latest filing's F460 line 19 `Amount_A`
- unitemized bucket = Σ(Form_Type=A line 2) + Σ(Form_Type=C line 2)

Live check (Bien Doan D7, through 6/30/2026): raised 117,125.37 · loans
20,000 · spent 108,905.71 · cash 32,668.66 — matches the portal PDFs, not the
malformed line 3/5.

**Invariants** (per filing: line 3 = 1 + 2, line 5 = 3 + 4; per committee:
period continuity, no gaps/overlaps, cash chain line 16 consistency). On
violation: quarantine the committee, reconcile against the filing PDF before
anything is written — never publish silently from broken arithmetic.

### Outside spending

- Sources: `S496` sheet ∪ `F460-D-ContribIndepExpn` rows with
  `Expn_Code=IND`, deduped by **(Filer_ID, Tran_ID)** — verified live: all 41
  Schedule D IND rows matched an S496 row by that key (S496: 174 rows /
  $653,351 in the 2026 file at audit time).
- Schedule D `MON`/`IKD` rows are contributions TO committees, not
  independent spending — excluded from outside totals.
- S496 target identity is structured (`Cand_NamL/F`, `Office_Cd`,
  `Office_Dscr`, `Dist_No`, `Supp_Opp_Cd`).
- Form 496 only captures qualifying IEs in the 90-day window; the Schedule D
  union closes most of that gap. Anything still uncovered goes in
  `outside_coverage_note`.
- S497 (24-hour late contributions) is a provisional recency signal only —
  never added to totals.

## Committee resolution (no CVR sheet exists)

Dry-run against the live 2026 roster cohort (all 6 D5/7/9 runoff candidates)
2026-08-10 produced the constraints below. Every candidate does resolve, but
naive name matching is unsafe.

- Durable key = FPPC ID (`Filer_ID` in workbook = `state_id` in search API).
  **`Filer_ID` is not always numeric** — the export contains the literal
  string `Pending` (observed on a 2024 committee still ID-less today), so the
  key type is text and `Pending` is never a durable identity; such committees
  fall back to normalized-name keys and cannot auto-link. (Whether `Pending`
  later flips to a real ID is unverified — confirm during live validation.)
- **`Cmtte_Type` is the safety gate, not the name.** Observed across both
  files: `C` (candidate-controlled), `P` (primarily formed), `G` (general
  purpose) — labels are the CAL spec's committee-type codes and match every
  spot-checked committee (IBEW 332 fund, Silicon Valley Biz PAC, COMMON GOOD
  = all `G`). Only `C` may feed direct totals; any code outside the known set
  fails closed. Cross-check against the search API's human-readable
  `committee_type` ("Candidate or Officeholder"). This matters because an
  outside committee
  can carry the candidate's name: "South Bay Working Families Supporting
  Ortiz for City Council 2026" (`P`, FPPC 1487316) sits next to "Peter Ortiz
  for San Jose City Council District 5 2026" (`C`, FPPC 1480385). Matching on
  name alone would book independent-expenditure money as the candidate's own
  fundraising.
- **District is NOT reliably in the committee name** — 2 of 6 lack it: "Nora
  Campos for San Jose City Council 2026", "Van Le for City Council 2026" (the
  latter omits the city too). Formats seen: `District 5`, `D7`, none. So
  district is a *confirming* signal when present, never a match requirement.
- Name normalization is mandatory: accented/unaccented city ("San José" vs
  "San Jose") and trailing-whitespace duplicates of the same `Filer_ID`.
- **Match on word tokens, never substring** — a case-insensitive substring
  probe for "Le" hit IBEW Local 332, Silicon Valley Biz PAC, and COMMON GOOD
  SILICON VALLEY (the "le" inside "Electrical"/"Valley"). Tokenized matching
  makes short surnames like Le safe.
- `Elect_Date` is dirty (observed `20260630` — a period date — and `None`), so
  it is a soft signal only; cycle gating comes from filing periods.
- Match to roster candidates by name tokens + `Cmtte_Type=C` + city-office
  name parse, confirmed by district and election year when present, reusing
  `personFirstNameNicknames` / `personNameMiddleEvidence` + suffix veto.
  **Given name AND surname must both match** (given name nickname-aware) —
  surname alone collides in live data: "Nora Campos … 2026" and "Pamela
  Campos … District 2 2024" are different people.
- Resolution must be unique within the roster cohort; ambiguous, duplicate, or
  unparseable committees fail closed (no auto-link, queued for manual link).

## Privacy and transport hardening

- Never persist contributor street addresses (`Ctrib_Adr*` columns are
  parsed past, not stored).
- Download client: allowlist hosts (`efile.sanjoseca.gov`,
  `efs-efile-campaign-exports.s3.amazonaws.com`), cap workbook size, validate
  XLSX/ZIP magic bytes before parsing.

## Phases

Phase 0 (export proof) is **done** — endpoint, sheet inventory, amendment
semantics, formulas, dedup, and a full resolver dry-run against the live
roster cohort audited 2026-08-10 with the 2025 + 2026 `most_recent_only`
files. Roster prerequisite is also met: the three Nov-3-2026 runoff races
(D5/7/9) exist with 2 candidates each, and all 6 map to a `Cmtte_Type=C`
committee in the export. That 6-candidate mapping is **provisional** — the
city finalizes its candidate list August 13, 2026; re-run the resolver
dry-run against the final roster before enabling sync.

### Phase 1: shared vendor module + parser — DONE (2026-08-10)

- Built: `efileCalFinance/efileCalBulkClient.ts` (agency config = key +
  portal base URL + export-host allowlist; export-URL resolution → JSON
  `{success, data}`; size-capped magic-checked download; ETag/Last-Modified
  artifact cache modeled on `calAccessRawDataArtifactCache.ts`) and
  `efileCalWorkbookParser.ts` (typed rows for F460-Summary, A, C, B1, D,
  S496, S497; keyed (Form_Type, Line_Item); memo-row aware; exact
  text-decimal → cents; addresses never surfaced).
- Tests off synthetic workbooks (12): keying, money edge cases, flag cells,
  lenient `Elect_Date` vs strict period dates, `Pending` filer ID, missing
  sheet/column/identity fail-closed, allowlist, size cap, cache
  unchanged/changed/force.
- Live-verified: both 2025+2026 workbooks parse whole (no rejected rows);
  Bien Doan reconciles cent-exact (raised 117,125.37 / spent 108,905.71 /
  cash 32,668.66 / net loans 20,000); real portal refresh → `downloaded`
  then `unchanged` on the ETag.

### Phase 2: San José agency adapter — eligibility + resolution — DONE (2026-08-10)

- Built: `sanJoseFinance/sanJoseFinanceEligibleOffices.ts` (GEOID `0668000`,
  keys `place::Mayor` + `place::City Council Member`, seat parse covering the
  catalog's actual "Member, City Council, District N" title, D1–D10) and
  `sanJoseCandidateCommitteeResolver.ts` (committee grouping by `Filer_ID`
  with Pending rows keyed by name; type gate = lone `C`, unknown/conflicting
  codes fail closed; person match via the shared `personNameMiddleEvidence`
  gates + `personFirstNameNicknames` VoteApp-side expansion; district / year /
  cross-office / foreign-office name evidence as vetoes; FPPC-id tier off
  `state_filing_ids`, with the same vetoes applied — `state_filing_ids` is
  candidate-global across races, so a stored id contradicted by the
  committee's own name evidence falls through to the name tier instead of
  linking; ambiguity fails closed in both directions and a blocked
  name-match also blocks its linkable sibling).
- Tests (26): the full Phase 6 resolver list (Ortiz `P` committee, Campos /
  Van Le district-less names, "Le" substring safety, Nora-vs-Pamela, accent
  variants, Pending, unknown types, suffix veto, nickname, quoted call names,
  both ambiguity directions) plus seat-parse and eligibility gates.
- Live-verified: resolver run against the real 2025+2026 workbooks (21,913
  rows → 35 committees) resolves all 6 D5/7/9 runoff candidates to 6 unique
  `C` committees by name, matching the Phase 0 manual dry-run. Roster is
  still provisional until the city's final candidate list (Aug 13) — re-run
  before enabling sync.

### Phase 3: aggregation — DONE (2026-08-10)

- Built: `sanJoseDirectFinanceAggregator.ts` (cycle formulas above off
  Amount_A only; canonical-filing selection — the live `most_recent_only`
  export carries committees with TWO current filings for one period,
  including two independent amendment chains for Van Le with their Schedule
  A rows duplicated, so one filing per period wins by latest Rpt_Date and the
  transaction sheets are filtered to the winners; occupations/employers/size
  buckets from canonical A + C rows, `Entity_Cd=IND`, memo excluded, refunds
  never bucketed; `reportedThrough`/`coverageStart` emitted) and
  `sanJoseOutsideSpendingAggregator.ts` (S496 ∪ Schedule D IND by
  (Filer_ID, Tran_ID); duplicate 496 REPORTS of one expenditure collapse to
  the latest report while same-key rows naming different targets are kept;
  token-based target-name matching via the resolver's shared person gates
  with office/jurisdiction/district as fail-closed vetoes on name-matched
  rows; direction only from literal SUPPORT/OPPOSE; measure rows excluded;
  Pending spenders group by normalized name). Industry/label classification
  stays at sync time (SF pattern) — aggregators emit raw names only.
- Invariants are a typed `violations` list, never a silent gate: line 3=1+2 /
  5=3+4 on both columns, period gap/overlap, duplicate-period filings,
  cash-chain (line 12 vs prior 16), nonzero opening cash
  (`prior_activity_uncovered`), rows-vs-cover reconciliation (Schedule A +
  A|2 = line 1, C + C|2 = line 4, B1 Loan_Amt1 = B1 summary line 1). Sync
  (Phase 5) decides quarantine and `direct_coverage_note` wording.
- Tests (19): formulas, Van Le duplicate chains, Bien Doan Amount_B error,
  Ortiz overlap/cash restatements, Altwer opening cash, missing core line vs
  legitimately absent A|2/B1 blocks, reconciliation drift, breakdown
  semantics, 496 duplicate report, multi-candidate mailers, D-IND union +
  MON/IKD exclusion, dirty target names, office/juris/district/direction
  vetoes, Pending spender grouping, mayor district veto.
- Live-verified (dry-run on the cached 2025+2026 workbooks): all six runoff
  candidates reconcile cent-exact to the Phase 0 manual audit (Bien Doan
  117,125.37 / 108,905.71 / 32,668.66 / loans 20,000); violations fire
  exactly on the known live defects — Doan's $20,000 YTD line-3 error, Van
  Le's duplicate chains (and her two other broken YTD line-3 filings), Ortiz
  beginning-cash restatements ($50/$500) + one-day overlap, Doan one-day gap
  + $4,449 year-boundary cash restatement, Altwer's uncovered 2025 activity
  ($47,353.73 opening cash — her 2025 filings are absent from the export;
  disclose via `direct_coverage_note` at sync). Outside: Ortiz support
  281,447.58 (dedup removed the double-reported $374.02), Campos oppose
  5,270.18, Doan 101,249.54, Altwer 118,723.85, Chester 1,255.68, Le 0; the
  10 candidate-less rows ($35,191.60) are ballot-measure spending, excluded.
- Store `reported_through` (latest covered `Thru_Date`) alongside totals so
  the UI never implies sync time = data recency (field emitted; persisted in
  Phase 4).

### Phase 4: schema, flags, writer — DONE

- Migration `233_add_san_jose_campaign_finance_tables.sql`: four `sjc_`
  tables modeled on SF (215 + 229) with SJ's differences — committee
  identity = FPPC id alone (no contest code / filer nid; `fppc_id` CHECK
  rejects the literal `Pending`); one donor-money `total_raised` (no
  headline/direct split, no public-funds column); `cash_on_hand` signed
  from day one (the GA/MA 231/232 lesson); `direct_coverage_note` column
  on summaries (per-candidate disclosure, e.g. Altwer's uncovered 2025);
  outside groups carry `expenditure_count` and include `spender_name` in
  the unique key so two id-less Pending spenders never collide. Validated
  on a scratch DB (constraints exercised: Pending rejected, negative cash
  accepted, negative flow rejected).
- Flags shipped (defaults false in code): `SAN_JOSE_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_ENABLED`,
  `SAN_JOSE_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_SYNC_ENABLED`,
  `SAN_JOSE_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_RAW_DATA_REFRESH_ENABLED`; all three `=true`
  in local `backend/.env`; read flag added to `render.yaml`.
- Source enum `SAN_JOSE_CITY_CLERK` in `ballotLookupFinanceShared.ts`
  (+ runtime `FINANCE_SUMMARY_SOURCES` mirror); label "City of San José
  Office of the City Clerk" in `FINANCE_SOURCE_LABELS`
  (`packages/api-client/src/format.ts`, shared by web + mobile) +
  `financeSourceLabel` test.
- `sanJoseFinanceWriter.ts`: `upsertSanJoseFinanceLink` (manual-link
  protection incl. last_verified_at advance on exact FPPC match, automatic
  conflict errors, active upsert deactivates other automatic links) +
  `replaceSanJoseCandidateFinanceSnapshot` (one transaction: link, summary,
  breakdowns, outside groups, optional industry classifications; integer
  cents → exact dollar strings; negative flows abort, signed cash passes).
  8 writer tests; module 58, full backend suite green.

### Phase 5: sync, loader, scripts — DONE (2026-08-11)

- Built: `sanJoseCandidateFinanceSync.ts` (per-candidate sync: committee
  presence check fails closed when a linked committee leaves the export;
  quarantine policy — blocking = filing_unusable / duplicate_summary_line /
  missing_summary_line / contribution_reconciliation / loan_cross_check,
  prior_activity_uncovered publishes WITH a per-candidate
  `direct_coverage_note`, the rest are diagnostics only since all six live
  committees trip them and still reconcile cent-exact; SF anomaly gates —
  reported_through regression never bypassable, 10× raised collapse on an
  unchanged filing set bypassable; employer-label classification
  deterministic + cached-manual only, zero AI; `loadSanJoseCycleWorkbookData`
  fetches the [year-1, year] workbook pair through the Phase 1 artifact
  cache, network-off unless the raw-data flag allows), plus the agency
  config (`csj`, S3 host allowlist) and methodology version `sj-2026.1`.
- `sanJoseCandidateFinanceAutoLink.ts`: SF-style missing-links selector
  (SJ place predicate + TS office gate + seat parse), resolution PER
  ELECTION via the Phase 2 resolver; matched → active `efile_export` link,
  ambiguous → needs_review, unmatched → no_committee; manual-link
  protection lives in the writer and surfaces as a per-candidate error.
- `sanJoseCandidateFinanceBatchSync.ts`: workbooks loaded once per election
  year (failures cached so the portal is hit once), auto-link leg
  warn-and-continue, stalest-first due loop, `electionId` backfill
  targeting. No SF-style stale-election leg: no relations table exists, and
  every snapshot rewrite advances `last_verified_at`.
- `sanJoseBallotLookupFinanceLoader.ts` registered in `ballotLookup.ts`
  (source `SAN_JOSE_CITY_CLERK`): loans surfaced, per-candidate
  `direct_coverage_note` threaded (omitted when null), real
  `expenditure_count` on outside groups, summary-URL fallback.
- Script `syncDueSanJoseCandidateFinance.ts` (`npm run
  san-jose-candidates:finance:sync-due`; strict flags, `--force`,
  `--bypass-anomaly-check`, `--election-id`); raw refresh gated by
  `SAN_JOSE_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_RAW_DATA_REFRESH_ENABLED`. Scheduler scripts
  deferred until San José gets an automated cadence.
- Tests: 27 new (sync 9, auto-link 6, batch 7, loader 5); module 85/85,
  full backend suite green.
- Live-verified 2026-08-11 (dry-run, no DB writes; fresh 2025+2026
  downloads): all 6 runoff candidates resolve 6 unique committees; Doan
  cent-exact vs the Phase 0 audit (117,125.37 / 108,905.71 / 32,668.66 /
  loans 20,000 / outside 101,249.54); Altwer 118,723.85 / Campos oppose
  5,270.18 / Chester 1,255.68 / Le 0 match Phase 3; Ortiz support
  281,447.58 → 292,697.58 (new IE filings since Aug 10). Coverage notes
  fire for Altwer AND Van Le (her export history opens 2025-07-01 with
  prior cash — new observation); zero blocking violations. The dry-run
  driver is a local UNVERSIONED scratch file
  (`backend/scratch/sjPhase5DryRun.ts`, gitignored); the post-Aug-13
  re-run can use it where it exists, or equivalently: refresh the
  workbooks via `loadSanJoseCycleWorkbookData`, list roster candidates
  with `listSanJoseCandidateElectionsMissingFinanceLinks`, resolve with
  `resolveSanJoseCandidateCommittees`, and run
  `syncSanJoseCandidateFinance` with `dryRun: true` per match.

### Phase 6: tests and live validation

- Unit: malformed summary math (Bien Doan case), cross-calendar-year cycle
  assembly, memo rows, A/C unitemized keying, 496/Schedule-D dedup, MON/IKD
  exclusion, missing occupation handling, address-privacy assertion.
- Resolver unit tests, each from a real observed case: `P`-type committee
  carrying a candidate's name is never linked (Ortiz), district-less committee
  names still resolve (Campos, Van Le), short surnames do not substring-match
  ("Le" vs IBEW/Silicon Valley/COMMON GOOD), same-surname different-person
  committees never cross-link (Nora vs Pamela Campos), accent and
  trailing-whitespace normalization (Doan), `Filer_ID='Pending'` is not a
  durable key, dirty `Elect_Date` does not gate, unknown `Cmtte_Type` codes
  fail closed.
- Live: sync the D5/7/9 runoff candidates; reconcile every written total
  against portal 460 PDFs; verify at least one IE committee shows correct
  direction; verify quarantine fires on the known malformed filing if still
  uncorrected.

**Live validation run, local DB, 2026-08-12 (all four checks passed):**

- Real writes: `npm run san-jose-candidates:finance:sync-due` auto-linked and
  wrote all 6 roster candidates, 0 failures, workbooks served from cache.
  (The CLI's `--dry-run` is a no-op on a cold database by design: the auto-link
  leg is skipped when dry, so nothing is ever due. Rehearse with the scratch
  driver, not with `--dry-run`.)
- PDF reconciliation: every one of the 30 Form 460 filings the export carries
  for these committees was downloaded from the portal
  (`/api/v1/public/document?doc_id=Ext_<filing_id>`, which returns a signed S3
  URL) and its whole summary page — lines 1–19, both columns — compared to the
  export. **30/30 cent-exact, zero mismatches.** Recomputing the published
  totals from the PDF numbers alone reproduces all four figures for all six
  candidates exactly. Column B (calendar YTD) is confirmed unreliable in the
  filings themselves (Ortiz's own B column drifts $710 off its own column A
  chain) — another reason the app sums column A.
- IE direction: the Government Attorneys' PAC 496 against Nora Campos is
  marked OPPOSE on the filed form and is stored as `oppose`; the committees
  stored as `support` are self-described supporting committees. Direction maps
  correctly both ways.
- Quarantine: fires as designed and blocks nothing — Doan's $20,000 line-3
  error, Le's three broken column-B lines and duplicate 2025 period, Ortiz's
  two cash-chain restatements and one period overlap, Altwer's and Le's
  prior-activity notes. All diagnostics; no committee was withheld.

**Defect found by this run (FIXED 2026-08-12, see below) — outside spending
misses paper filings.**
The bulk export carries e-filed data only. Santa Clara County Government
Attorneys' Association PAC filed *two* 496s opposing Nora Campos: `24950`
(e-filed, $5,270.18, in the export) and `24823` (paper/scanned, $5,270.27,
filed 05/12/2026 via netfile.com, **absent from the export**). The e-filed
form's own "cumulative to date" line — $10,540.45 — proves the pair. So
Campos's published oppose total is roughly half the real figure, with no
disclosure. Scope citywide for 2026: 4 paper 496/497 filings total, of which
these 2 are 496s; **no candidate committee among the six has a paper 460**, so
the direct-money side is unaffected. Attribution is the hard part — the portal
search index exposes the *spender*, never the target, and a scanned 496 has no
text layer, so a cross-check could only say "N paper IE filings exist
citywide", which would tag all six candidates for one candidate's gap. Options,
in order of preference: (a) leave the totals alone and treat paper IEs as
manual research; (b) add an outside-coverage note driven by an operator-curated
list; (c) OCR the scans.

**Fix shipped 2026-08-12: curated paper-496 supplements.**
`sanJosePaperFilingSupplements.ts` holds operator-verified transcriptions of
paper 496 expenditure lines (spender, target as printed, office/district,
direction, amount, portal e_filing_id, source note). Automated attribution was
confirmed impossible first: the raw S496 sheet has no `Cum_YTD` column (only
Schedules A/C carry one) — the cumulative printed on the 496 PDF is
vendor-rendered from data the XLSX never carries — and the search index names
the spender, never the target. Supplements are validated at module load (fail
loud: blank fields, nonpositive amounts, non-ISO dates, duplicate
filing+target), keyed by `electionYear` (sync applies only the matching
cycle), and fed through the aggregator's normal target-match and veto pipeline
as synthetic rows in a `paper-496-` Tran_ID namespace, so they can never
collide with export rows and a mistyped target simply matches nobody.
Maintenance contract in the module header: add an entry only after reading the
scan AND confirming the expenditure is absent from the export; re-verify when
re-auditing a cycle (a later e-filed amendment re-reporting the expenditure
would double-count). One entry shipped: the anti-Campos paper 496
(e_filing_id 24823, $5,270.27). Live re-sync confirms Campos oppose =
$10,540.45 — exactly the PAC's own sworn cumulative — with every other
candidate unchanged.

## Limitations and risk register

- Export covers e-filed statements only. Confirmed live 2026-08-12: paper
  filings exist and are invisible to the export (see the Phase 6 Campos 496
  case above). Candidate committees all e-file, so the direct side is safe;
  outside spending is not. If a qualifying
  candidate has such a gap, disclose via `direct_coverage_note`
  (field exists in `ballotLookupFinanceShared.ts`; Georgia uses it).
- Filing lag: totals are as of `reported_through`, surfaced in UI.
- CARS (risk register, not v1 work): SOS's CAL-ACCESS replacement lands after
  the Nov 2026 election; no evidence it changes this vendor's local export.
  Keep parsing behind one interface; revisit when the vendor announces.

## Reuse beyond San José

- **San Diego (same vendor, near-drop-in)**: `efile.sandiego.gov` verified
  2026-08-10 with the identical Bulk Export (XLSX CAL 2.20, 2018–2026).
  A San Diego module = `efileCalFinance` agency config + its own eligible
  offices/GEOID + resolver quirks. Council districts 2/4/6/8 are on the Nov
  2026 ballot. Recommended fast-follow.
- **NetFile jurisdictions (future, different client)**: most CA local
  agencies (Oakland, Berkeley, Sacramento, Fresno, Santa Clara County, …)
  expose CAL-format public exports/APIs via NetFile. Same parser core,
  different transport. Build only when a covered city has roster candidates.
- **Other states: no reuse.** CAL is California-only.

# Nevada campaign finance — implementation plan

Status: **Phases 0-3 DONE (Phase 2 run 2026-08-27: 95/108 candidates imported
into the local DB; harvest gotchas + unlinked list in the feasibility doc
Addendum 5. Phase 3 ship 2026-08-27: flag in `backend/.env` + `render.yaml`,
NEVADA_AURORA display label + portal home URL in `packages/api-client`,
ballot-page spot-check green — prod promotion tracked in the memory topic).** Phase 0: fixtures in
`backend/tests/fixtures/nevadaFinance/` (5/5 reconciliation exact). Phase 1:
migration 258, `backend/src/pipeline/nevadaFinance/` (CSV + report parsers,
selection, cycle builder, aggregator, resolver, writer, loader), CLIs
`nevada-candidates:finance:auto-link` / `:import`, 26 tests. Note: the shared
loader publishes `direct_contribution_total` as the displayed total_raised;
since PR #912 the import stores donor money (lines 1+5+7) there and the
official line-8 gross in `total_receipts`; the itemized CSV sum stays
internal to the reconciliation gate. Next: prod promotion (runbook steps in
the memory topic), then Phase 4 Oct refresh.
Feasibility detail in `backend/docs/nevada-campaign-finance.md`.

## Scope and non-goals

Ship for Nov-2026 NV races filed with the SOS jurisdiction (statewide,
legislature, state judicial — **195 filers for election year 2026**):

- total raised, total spent, cash on hand (official report-summary lines)
- itemized direct-donor lists, contribution-size buckets
- industry breakdowns for **entity donors only** (label: "industries among
  identifiable organization donors"; ~39% of dollars on the single Governor
  fixture — not a statewide coverage estimate), via the existing donor/industry
  classifier

Structural non-goals (Nevada does not disclose them — never synthesize):

- donor occupation/employer: NRS 294A collects name + address only
- candidate-level outside spending and support/oppose: the C&E expense
  schedule has no target-candidate or stance field (verified on 2 IE filers +
  1 PAC + the expenditure search schema). UI shows "not available in Nevada SOS report data".
  Federal NV races keep the FEC path.
- county/city-jurisdiction filers (values 1–35 in the jurisdiction dropdown):
  deferable; same system if wanted later.

## Source facts the design rests on (all verified live)

- One system: AURORA search at
  `https://www.nvsos.gov/SOSCandidateServices/AnonymousAccess/CEFDSearchUU/Search.aspx`.
  Plain WebForms POST with `search_type` = `#individual_search` /
  `#group_search` / `#contribution_search` / `#expenditure_search`.
- **Imperva WAF blocks every non-browser client** (curl and Node fetch get the
  212-byte `_Incapsula_Resource` challenge; cookie replay from a challenged
  response does NOT unlock — verified). Page-context `fetch` in a real browser
  works. So raw acquisition is a **browser-session harvest**, not a server sync.
- Transaction searches accept a **date-only query** (no name) and an
  "Export Results to CSV Only" checkbox that returns `text/csv` from the POST.
  Result cap: June 2026 statewide = 4,322 rows OK; Apr–Jun = "too many
  results" (cap also applies to CSV mode). **Month slices work; halve on cap.**
- CSV columns — contributions: `Contributor, Date, Amount, Type, Recipient,
  Report`; expenditures: `Payee, Date, Amount, Type, Payer, Report`. No
  address, no category, no IDs. Amounts `"$5,000.00"`, dates `M/D/YYYY`.
- **Amendments replace**: transaction search returns only the amended report's
  rows (two fixtures: Lombardo 2022 Q3, Hansen 2024 Q4). Report *lists* on
  detail pages show both versions — totals must pick one document per logical
  report, never both.
- `Report` values are filer-typed display names: `2026 CE Report 2`,
  `… (Amended)`, `… (Legal Defense Fund)`, `… (Amended, Legal Defense Fund)`,
  annual filings, and junk like `Tick`. Treat as opaque strings; the only
  parsing is the `(… Legal Defense Fund…)` suffix (exclude those rows/reports).
- Individual search with `ddlJurisdiction=36` ("NV SOS", numeric option
  values) + `ddlElectionYear` returns the roster grid (Name | Party |
  Jurisdiction, 25/page) with `CandidateDetails.aspx?o=<token>&y=<year>`
  links. The detail page adds Office **with district** ("State Assembly,
  District 32") and the report list with `ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=<token>`
  links. `syn` tokens are stable across sessions (23-day-old links still
  resolve); `o=` token stability unverified — re-resolve by search.
- Two relevant report layouts observed (recall-committee and other niche forms
  unprobed): candidate form = $100 threshold, summary lines 1–13
  (7 = unitemized ≤$100 aggregate, 8 = total raised, 12 = total spent,
  13 = ending fund balance). PAC/IE/party form = $1,000 threshold, lines 1–8,
  **no unitemized line, no balance line**. Candidate cumulative column starts
  at CE#1 (Jan 1 of election year) — it does NOT include prior-year money.

## Architecture (clone New Hampshire, swap the transport)

Reuse the NH module shape end-to-end; the only novel part is that artifacts
are harvested by a Claude browser session instead of `fetch` in the refresh
script.

1. **Artifacts** under `scratch/nevada-campaign-finance/aurora/` with sidecar
   metadata JSON (mirror `newHampshireCfsArtifactCache` conventions):
   - `contributions/YYYY-MM.csv` and `expenditures/YYYY-MM.csv` — statewide
     month-sliced date-only CSV exports (split `a`/`b` halves when capped)
   - `candidates/<election-year>/roster.json` — paged individual-search grid
     for jurisdiction 36 (name, party, detail token)
   - `candidates/<election-year>/<candidate-key>/reports.json` — detail-page
     office/district + report list (name, file date, `syn` token)
   - `reports/<syn-hash>.html` — raw `ViewCCEReport` pages for linked
     candidates' non-LDF reports
   The harvest procedure is a documented page-context JS loop (the exact POST
   bodies are in `backend/docs/nevada-campaign-finance.md`) run from a Claude
   session with the browser pane; files land via Bash. No scheduler, no WAF
   games server-side.
2. **Pipeline** `backend/src/pipeline/nevadaFinance/`:
   - artifact reader/validators (CSV header + month coverage checks)
   - report-summary parser (both form layouts; picks the amended document when
     a `(Amended)` sibling exists for the same logical report)
   - candidate resolver: VoteApp roster → individual-search roster by
     normalized name, confirmed by office + district read off the
     **Year-matched report rows** on the detail page (the profile Office is the
     filer's current seat, not the candidacy — Cannizzaro fixture); ambiguous
     names (2+ AURORA matches) stay unlinked
   - direct-contribution aggregator: month CSVs filtered to
     `Recipient == linked filer name`, LDF rows dropped; buckets +
     entity-donor industry labels (existing classifier, `labelType:"donor"`);
     **skip breakdowns entirely for a candidate whose filer name is not unique
     in the cycle's CSVs** (name is the only join key). Implemented as far as
     the data allows: same-year duplicates explode at roster read (slug
     collision), and in-window rows citing only report years outside
     electionYear-1..+1 quarantine the candidate (cross-cycle same-name
     collision). A same-cycle same-name filer outside the harvested roster is
     undetectable from CSV data; residual exposure is breakdowns-only (totals
     come from report covers) and bounded by the reconciliation ceiling
   - summary builder: raised/spent = Σ per-report "This Period" lines 8/12
     (candidate form) across the cycle window (Annual filings + CE#1–4),
     picking the latest effective version per covered period, LDF excluded;
     cash = line 13 of the report covering the **latest period end** (latest
     version of that period — NOT the newest file date; a late amendment to an
     old quarter can be the newest filing). Line 8 is the state's official
     "Total Amount of All Contributions" and includes loan-type lines 2/3 (and
     invisibly, loan-flagged rows inside line 1; the CSV has no loan flag) —
     see the Phase-2 loan gate. Never read the cumulative column as a
     cross-year total (it restarts at CE#1 each election year).
   - snapshot writer via `createStandardStateFinanceSnapshotWriter` into new
     `nv_candidate_finance_*` tables (one migration, NH-shaped); outside-group
     tables created but never populated
3. **Read side**: `nevadaBallotLookupFinanceLoader.ts` registered in
   `src/pipeline/address/ballotLookup.ts`, flag
   `NEVADA_CAMPAIGN_FINANCE_ENABLED` (free read-side flag → ON in
   `backend/.env` + `render.yaml` once data exists), eligible-offices module,
   coverage note: "Nevada does not collect donor occupation or employer;
   industry breakdowns cover identifiable organization donors only, and
   contribution-size buckets cover itemized transactions only (truly
   unitemized ≤$100 money stays in totals). Candidate target and
   support/oppose direction are not available in Nevada SOS report data.
   Coverage is the searchable electronic filings only (NRS 294A.3733 exempts
   some small filers; pre-2004 and paper filings are out of scope)" — an
   unmatched or exempt filer renders as "no filing found in the electronic
   system", never $0.
4. **CLI** (npm scripts, matching house naming):
   - `nevada-candidates:finance:import` — read artifacts, aggregate, write
     snapshots (idempotent, `--dry-run`)
   - `nevada-candidates:finance:auto-link` — roster resolver with report
   No sync-due/scheduler scripts: refresh cadence is quarterly filings, run by
   hand after each deadline.

## Phases

**Phase 0 — fixtures, no product code. [DONE 2026-08-26]** Both questions
answered (annual filings self-contained, period==cumulative; CE chain restarts
yearly; CSV gate = lines 1+5 ≤ Σ ≤ 1+5+7 because filers may itemize ≤$100
rows) and reconciliation exact 5/5 — see the feasibility doc addendum 3 and
the fixtures README. Original scope: harvest one month of CSVs + five
candidate report sets (Governor, AG, one Assembly, one state Senate, one
judicial; include one amended report and one LDF filer). Answer the two open
semantics questions with fixtures: (a) Annual CE Filing summary columns
(period vs cumulative meaning) so the cycle-window sum is provably right;
(b) confirm summary-vs-CSV reconciliation on all five (expect: CSV Σ = lines
1+5, gap = line 7). Output: fixture files checked into the repo test dir +
a short findings note appended to the feasibility doc. Exit: reconciliation
exact on 5/5.

**Phase 1 — PR: schema + pipeline + tests.** Migration, readers, parsers,
resolver, aggregators, summary builder, writer, loader, flag, CLIs, vitest
coverage driven by the Phase-0 fixtures (including: amended-pair selection,
LDF exclusion, dual layout, ambiguous-name skip, cap-split month files).

**Phase 2 — full harvest + local run.** Cycle window artifacts (monthly CSVs
2025-01 → current, both kinds ≈ 40 files; roster + report lists for the 195
filers; report HTML for linked Nov-2026 candidates), auto-link with per-link
report, import, gates below. Local DB only.

**Phase 3 — ship.** Loader flag ON locally, spot-check ballot pages, then the
standard prod checklist (migration → data promotion → env flag in render.yaml
+ Render env, manual deploy per runbook).

**Phase 4 — Oct refresh.** After the Oct 15 CE#3 deadline (covers through
Sep 30): harvest new months + new reports, re-import, re-promote. Same by-hand
run; CE#4/annual lands Jan 15, 2027 (post-election, optional).

## Validation gates (import refuses to write on failure)

- per-candidate: Σ itemized CSV (non-LDF, monetary+in-kind) within
  [Σ lines 1+5, Σ lines 1+5+7] for the same window (filers may itemize ≤$100
  money, so unitemized line 7 is the allowed slack); expenditure CSV sum
  within [Σ lines 9+10, Σ lines 9+10+11]; else quarantine the candidate
- every linked candidate: office + district + year matched exactly; name
  unique in AURORA roster
- month coverage: contiguous month files spanning the cycle window, each
  either uncapped or fully split
- no occupation-labeled output anywhere; no outside-group rows anywhere
- Phase 2 additionally: locate ≥1 loan-flagged filer among Nov-2026 candidates
  (schedule checkbox / summary lines 2–3 nonzero); if loan money is material,
  decide the totalReceipts treatment before shipping — otherwise record
  "immaterial for this cycle" in the run notes

## Open items (tracked, not blocking)

- `o=` candidate-token stability across sessions (works around it by design)
- optional email to NV SOS: sanctioned bulk route ("Bulk Data Download" exists
  behind account login) and whether any nonpublic candidate-target/stance
  field exists (NRS 294A.210 doesn't require one — expect no). A bulk account
  would replace the CSV harvest but changes nothing downstream.

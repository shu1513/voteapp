<!--
The frontend must copy these strings verbatim. Version bumps to
disclaimer.md require re-review of this file too.
1.1 → 1.2 (2026-08-21): reviewed for the Terms 1.2 support-payments bump —
every published string below is unchanged. One-time payments ride the
three-document acceptance. Monthly memberships additionally carry their own
auto-renewal consent INSIDE Stripe Checkout (consent_collection required +
custom renewal-terms text near the unchecked box: amount, monthly renewal,
cancel-anytime — CA BPC §17602; see docs/plans/membership-contributions.md).
That checkout copy lives in the backend session-creation call, not here,
because Stripe renders it.

1.4 presentation revision (2026-08-30), PRE-SEARCH GATE ONLY. The anonymous
dialog dropped two paragraphs — the arbitration restatement and the long
privacy notice — and its checkbox label was cut to the three document names.
The version did NOT bump, and that is the right call rather than an oversight:
terms-of-use.md, privacy-policy.md and disclaimer.md are byte-identical (the
pinned SHA-256 values in legalCopy.test.ts did not move), so the agreement a
visitor enters is the same agreement, presented shorter. A bump would have
forced every account through re-acceptance for a change to nothing they
accepted. What did change is that "1.4" now covers two pre-search screens, so
the boundary is recorded here: acceptances before 2026-08-30 saw the
four-paragraph dialog naming arbitration; acceptances after saw this file's
current text. Rationale for the removals is in "Why arbitration is not
named on any checkbox screen" and under the short privacy note.

1.4 presentation revision (2026-08-31), SIGNUP AND RE-ACCEPTANCE. The signup
label dropped its closing arbitration sentence and the re-acceptance label its
"including the agreement..." clause, for the same reason the pre-search gate
was trimmed the day before: Section 12 is stated in the linked Terms of Use,
and restating it beside the checkbox repeated a linked document as scare copy.
The version again did NOT bump — the three pinned documents are byte-identical,
so the agreement entered is the same agreement. Boundary for the acceptance
ledger: user_terms_acceptances rows for 1.4 written before 2026-08-31 came
from labels naming arbitration in full; rows after came from this file's
current text.

Clickwrap requirements (Meyer v. Uber; Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble; Berman v.
Freedom Financial Network):
- Checkbox UNCHECKED by default; the action button stays disabled until
  checked.
- Checkbox sits directly above the action button it gates.
- [Terms of Use] / [Privacy Policy] / [Disclaimer] render as clearly visible
  links right next to the checkbox — no tiny gray text, no footer-only links.
  On every gate this is now the ENTIRE notice, since no clause is called out
  anywhere any more (see the 2026-08-30 and 2026-08-31 revision notes above),
  so weakening those links is the one edit that would actually cost us
  Section 12.
- Signup acceptance is recorded server-side: POST /api/auth/register requires
  accepted_terms_version matching CURRENT_TERMS_VERSION
  (backend/src/constants/legal.ts); stored on the user row with a timestamp.
  Registration always asks for its own acceptance: an anonymous acceptance on
  the same browser proves nothing about who owns the account.
- The users columns hold only the CURRENT version, and re-acceptance
  overwrites them, so every acceptance is also appended to
  user_terms_acceptances (migration 201). That table is the answer to "what
  has this account ever accepted"; the users columns answer "what is it on
  now", which is what the re-acceptance interstitial reads. Registration and
  renewal write their history row in the same statement or transaction as the
  users write, so an account can never claim a version with no history behind
  it. Rows are append-only: UPDATE is rejected, and DELETE is rejected unless
  the account itself is being deleted.
- Two limits on that table, stated here so nobody describes it as more than it
  is. It does not reach back before migration 201: accounts that accepted 1.0
  and later re-accepted 1.1 had the 1.0 acceptance overwritten in place on
  2026-07-18, and only a pre-bump backup can recover it. And acceptance rows
  are deleted with the account, so a closed account leaves no acceptance
  evidence at all — deliberate, because keeping it would be a retention
  practice the privacy policy does not describe.
- The wording behind a version is pinned by hash in
  packages/api-client/src/legalCopy.test.ts. A version string is only worth
  what the text behind it is, so editing terms-of-use.md, privacy-policy.md,
  or disclaimer.md fails CI until someone decides whether the edit keeps the
  version or needs a bump and re-acceptance.
- Registration and the re-acceptance interstitial keep their checkbox INLINE
  on the page: both gate an explicit account action the visitor came to take.
- The anonymous pre-search gate is DEFERRED instead: the home page carries no
  checkbox and no legal box, and pressing Search opens the terms dialog. Assent
  is asked for at the moment it gates something, which is where the clickwrap
  cases put it (Meyer v. Uber). Notice sitting apart from the action is the
  weak pattern — Nicosia v. Amazon turned on exactly that.
- Anonymous search acceptance is ENFORCED server-side but never stored: POST
  /api/address/resolve requires accepted_terms_version matching
  CURRENT_TERMS_VERSION and refuses the search otherwise, so the gate is real
  rather than a disabled button a direct API call walks around. Nothing about
  the acceptance is persisted — an anonymous visitor's IP and user agent are
  deliberately NOT collected, so the evidence is this file plus the deployed
  gate, not a row per search.
- Acceptance IS remembered on the device for 90 days, keyed to the terms
  version (frontend/src/lib/termsAcceptance.ts and the mobile port). Re-asking
  a returning visitor on every search teaches click-through, which weakens
  assent; the trigger that requires fresh consent is a version change, which
  the version check enforces. Remembering may ONLY decide whether the dialog
  opens. When a dialog opens its checkbox starts empty — a pre-ticked box shows
  assent nobody gave, and that is the thing that must never come back.
- The privacy note must stay beside the address field, not only inside the
  dialog: the autocomplete forwards typed fragments after three characters, so
  collection begins before Search is ever pressed and notice has to arrive at
  or before collection.
- The pre-search checkbox label is a SUMMARY; the sentences it does not carry
  appear above it in the dialog. It names the three documents and nothing else
  — see "Why arbitration is not named on any checkbox screen" below, and do
  not add a clause callout back to any label without reading that section
  first.
- All of this copy lives in packages/api-client/src/legalCopy.ts, and
  legalCopy.test.ts asserts every string still appears in this file. That suite
  also pins arbitration and the class-action waiver OUT of every label, so the
  restatement cannot creep back one screen at a time.

# Checkbox and notice copy — Version 1.4

## Pre-search terms dialog (anonymous address search)

Opened by pressing **Search**. Heading: **Before we search**. Body, in order:
the two paragraphs below, the short privacy note, then the checkbox and its
three document links, then **Cancel** and **Agree and search**.

> [ ] I have read and agree to the [Terms of Use], [Privacy Policy], and
> [AI Research and Election Information Disclaimer].

Rules for the dialog: the box is empty every time it opens; **Agree and search**
stays disabled until it is ticked and names what it does rather than saying
"Continue"; the document links open in a new tab so reading one does not
discard the dialog or the address already typed; Cancel, Escape, and the
backdrop close it without agreeing and leave the typed address alone; no
forced scrolling through the documents.

### Dialog paragraphs

> Elections Simplified provides AI-assisted informational research only. It is
> not an official election source, and results may be inaccurate, incomplete,
> outdated, or misleading.
>
> You must verify voting, registration, ballot, district, polling-place,
> deadline, and election-result information with official election authorities
> before relying on it.

### Why arbitration is not named on any checkbox screen

No label in this file — pre-search, signup, or re-acceptance — mentions
arbitration or the class-action waiver, and that is deliberate:

- What the clickwrap cases require is conspicuous notice of the **documents**
  plus an unambiguous act of assent, not a callout of any one clause. The Uber
  registration screen upheld in *Meyer v. Uber Technologies*, 868 F.3d 66 (2d
  Cir. 2017) read "By creating an Uber account, you agree to the TERMS OF
  SERVICE & PRIVACY POLICY" and never used the word "arbitration". An empty
  checkbox that gates the action clears that bar by a wider margin than Uber's
  click-to-continue did.
- Section 12 is stated once, in the Terms of Use. Restating it beside a
  checkbox repeats a linked document as a lawsuit warning on a screen someone
  came to for something else — a ballot lookup, an account, a version bump.
- What a Section 12 motion rests on is the assent evidence, not a clause
  restatement: for accounts, the `user_terms_acceptances` rows recording
  acceptance of the named documents; for anonymous searchers, this file plus
  the deployed gate.

The Terms of Use link beside each checkbox is what carries the whole of the
notice. It is not optional and it may not be demoted to the footer: the link,
named and adjacent at the moment of assent, is the basis on which Section 12
binds at all.

## Signup checkbox (account registration)

> [ ] I am at least 18 years old, and I have read and agree to the
> [Terms of Use], [Privacy Policy], and [AI Research and Election Information
> Disclaimer]. I consent to enter this agreement electronically. I understand
> that Elections Simplified is not an official election source, does not register voters
> or cast ballots, and may display AI-assisted content that must be
> independently verified with official election authorities.

## Re-acceptance checkbox (signed-in interstitial after a version bump)

> [ ] I have read and agree to the updated [Terms of Use], [Privacy Policy],
> and [AI Research and Election Information Disclaimer].

## Short privacy note (beside every address input, and in the pre-search dialog)

This carries the address-specific points that matter at collection. It carries
no Privacy Policy link of its own: the footer links the policy on every page,
the explainer beside this note links it directly, and the pre-search dialog
links it in the row under the checkbox — so a second inline copy sat next to
the question people actually ask and crowded it out. The 14-day lookup cache
and the "not sold" assurance are carried by Privacy Policy Section 1 rather
than repeated here, to keep this line to the two facts a visitor weighs while
typing — what the address is used for, and that it does not end up on their
account.

This line also replaced the longer privacy paragraph the pre-search dialog used
to carry. That paragraph summarised the whole of Privacy Policy Section 1 —
address, account data, device and usage data, purposes, legal compliance — one
click away from the policy it was summarising, and its opening clause ("we
collect the address you enter") implied retention the system does not perform:
the address is sent to the Census geocoder, held in an anonymous 14-day cache
in its normalised form, and never written to the database or attached to an
account, which stores district ids only.

> The address is only used to find voting districts. We don’t save it to
> your account.

Beside the anonymous-search note, **Why do we need the full address?** opens
an informational dialog on web and mobile. One paragraph: the ballot depends
on which voting districts a home sits in, and those boundaries do not follow
ZIP codes — they can split a neighborhood or a single street, so two homes in
the same ZIP can vote in different races. The dialog repeats the
address-handling summary, links to the Privacy Policy, and closes with **Got
it**. It has no checkbox or agreement button because it explains the field
rather than requesting consent.

## Results verification line (ballot and results screens)

Non-blocking, and deliberately not gated on acceptance: it has to reach the
people the clickwrap never did — a shared computer, someone else's phone, a
link from a text message.

> AI-assisted research. Verify voting information with official election
> authorities. [Disclaimer]

## Per-record source line (candidate records, measures, results)

> Source: [link] · researched [date]

## Notification email footer line

> Information is AI-assisted research; verify with official sources before
> voting.
